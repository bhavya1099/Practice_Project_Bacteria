**Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of the x-coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getXBasicTest
  Description: This test verifies that the getX method correctly retrieves the x-coordinate of the Address instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with a known x-coordinate.
  Act: Call the getX() method on the instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned x-coordinate equals the known value set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getX method correctly returns the initialized x-coordinate value. It's significant because it ensures the method's reliability in fetching the correct value representing the horizontal position of the Address.

**Scenario 2: Default value for x-coordinate in new Address instance**

Details:
  TestName: getXForNewInstanceTest
  Description: This test checks the default value returned by getX when a new Address instance is initialized without explicit x-coordinate setting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new Address with minimal parameters assuming default constructor behavior sets x to a default.
  Act: Invoke the getX method on the new Address instance.
  Assert: Assess whether the result matches the expected default value (if defined, otherwise check for zero or null behavior).
Validation:
  This test helps confirm the default state of an Address instance regarding its x-coordinate, which can be crucial for understanding uninitialized state behavior in the Address class.

**Scenario 3: Consistency of getX value on multiple calls**

Details:
  TestName: getXConsistencyTest
  Description: This test ensures that the getX method returns the same x-coordinate value across multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with a fixed x-coordinate.
  Act: Call getX method multiple times on the same instance.
  Assert: Compare that all returned values from these calls are identical.
Validation:
  Validates that getX method offers consistent results, which is essential for the reliability and predictability of the method’s behavior.

**Scenario 4: Higher boundary value for x-coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getXHighBoundaryTest
  Description: This test verifies getX method behavior when the x-coordinate is set to a particularly high value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Address instance with a high boundary value for x.
  Act: Retrieve x-coordinate using getX method.
  Assert: Confirm that the value retrieved matches the set high boundary value.
Validation:
  The purpose of this test is to ensure that the getX method accurately handles and returns high boundary values, which is crucial for the application's robustness, especially in scenarios where large grid dimensions are expected.

**Scenario 5: X-coordinate value after Address object modification**

Details:
  TestName: getXAfterModificationTest
  Description: Confirm that the getX update to Address object reflects correctly post-modification, assuming some way to modify instance directly since no setters are shown.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create Address instance with a specific x. Alter the Address x value manually if the class structure allows.
  Act: Fetch the x-coordinate using getX.
  Assert: Assert that the fetched value corresponds to the newly modified value.
Validation:
  This scenario checks that modifications to the Address object’s state are reflected in subsequent method calls, validating the mutability and dynamic data integrity of the Address class.

These scenarios fundamentally focus on ensuring that the getX method functions correctly across various typical and boundary cases, contributing to comprehensive testing of the Address class's basic functionality.
