Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `getX()` method in the `Address` class:

---

**Scenario 1: Get X Coordinate of Address When Valid**

Details:
  TestName: getXOfValidAddress
  Description: Validates that the getX() method accurately retrieves the x-coordinate from an instance of Address that has been initialized with valid x and y coordinates.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with a specific x-coordinate.
  Act: Call the getX() method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the initialized x-coordinate.

Validation:
  Our assertion aims to verify that the X value retrieved by getX() is identical to the one with which the Address object was initialized. This is crucial to ensure data integrity and correctness of the Address object's state.

---

**Scenario 2: Get X Coordinate at Boundaries**

Details:
  TestName: getXOnBoundaryValues
  Description: Ensures the getX() method can correctly handle and return x-coordinate values at the edge of typical integer ranges, specifically testing minimal (0) and maximal (Integer.MAX_VALUE) boundary values.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two separate instances of Address, one initialized at the lower boundary (0) and another at the upper boundary (Integer.MAX_VALUE) for x-coordinate.
  Act: Invoke getX() on both instances.
  Assert: Check that the returned values from each call match their respective initialized values.

Validation:
  The tests are significant in verifying that getX() can handle edge cases in x-coordinate values, reflecting the robustness and reliability of the method in various operational scenarios.

---

**Scenario 3: Get X Coordinate Consistency Check**

Details:
  TestName: consistentGetXReturnValue
  Description: Test to confirm that repeated calls to getX() return consistent results, ensuring that the method does not inadvertently modify the state of the Address object or is affected by external changes.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address with a predetermined x-coordinate.
  Act: Call getX() multiple times on the same Address instance.
  Assert: Compare the results of all calls to ensure they are the same.

Validation:
  This test checks the immutability and state consistency of the getX() method over sequential invocations, which is fundamental for the reliability of data retrieval from the Address object.

---

These test scenarios focus explicitly on different aspects of the getX() method from boundary value examination to consistency and normal operational checks, ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliable functionality of the method in the Address class.
