### Test Scenarios for the `getY()` Method of the `Address` Class

---

#### Scenario 1: Valid Y Coordinate Retrieval

**Details:**  
  TestName: testValidYCoordinateRetrieval  
  Description: Ensure that the `getY()` method correctly retrieves the Y coordinate of the Address instance that was set during initialization. This test checks if the method functions correctly under normal circumstances.

**Execution:**  
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object with specific X and Y coordinates (e.g., 3, 5).  
  Act: Invoke the `getY()` method on the Address instance.  
  Assert: Assert that the return value is the expected Y coordinate (5 in this case).

**Validation:**  
  This assertion verifies that getY correctly returns the initialized Y coordinate of the Address object. It confirms the method's ability to handle and return accurate position data, which is critical for managing spatial relationships in the application.

---

#### Scenario 2: Boundary Condition Check at Zero

**Details:**  
  TestName: testGetYAtBoundaryZero  
  Description: Validates whether the getY method correctly retrieves the Y coordinate when it is set to the minimum boundary value (0). This test helps to ensure that boundary conditions are handled properly.

**Execution:**  
  Arrange: Initialize an Address object at the origin (0,0).  
  Act: Call the `getY()` method on this Address instance.  
  Assert: Check that the method returns 0.

**Validation:**  
  This test ensures that `getY()` can accurately retrieve a Y coordinate set at the lowest possible boundary. This boundary check is essential to prevent errors in applications dealing with grid or map boundaries.

---

#### Scenario 3: Edge Case Near Maximum Value of Y

**Details:**  
  TestName: testGetYAtHighBoundary  
  Description: Checks if the `getY()` function retrieves the correct Y coordinate near the maximum allowable value for the grid or map (assuming a pre-defined limit, e.g., max Y value of `size-1` if `size` is known).

**Execution:**  
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with a Y coordinate set to its near-maximum possible value (e.g., if size = 10, then y = 9).  
  Act: Invoke `getY()` method on this instance.  
  Assert: Validate that the return value equals the set Y coordinate (9 in this example).

**Validation:**  
  Ensuring that the `getY()` method returns correct values at high boundary limits is crucial for the reliable operation of spatial controls and navigation within the application, especially in constrained environments or large grid-based systems.

---

#### Scenario 4: Consistency Check Across Multiple Calls

**Details:**  
  TestName: testGetYConsistencyAcrossCalls  
  Description: Tests if consecutive calls to `getY()` return consistent results, ensuring the methodâ€™s reliability over repeated accesses.

**Execution:**  
  Arrange: Create an Address object with any Y value (e.g., Y = 7).  
  Act: Call `getY()` multiple times on the same object.  
  Assert: Assert that all calls return the same value.

**Validation:**  
  This test checks if the `getY()` is free from side-effects, returning consistent results across multiple invocations. Constant and reliable access to property values like coordinates is fundamental for the integrity and stability of grid-based or spatial referencing systems in the application.

---

These scenarios comprehensively examine the functionality, boundary handling, and reliability of the `getY()` method, ensuring its robustness within the Address class's usage context.
