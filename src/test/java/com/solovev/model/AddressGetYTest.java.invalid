**Scenario 1: Verify getY for Valid Position**

Details:  
TestName: getYReturnsCorrectYValue  
Description: This test verifies that the getY method correctly returns the 'y' coordinate of the Address. It checks that the returned value matches the expected 'y' value that was set during the instantiation of the Address object.

Execution:  
Arrange: Create an instance of Address with a specific 'y' value.  
Act: Call the getY method on the Address instance.  
Assert: Assert that the returned value from getY is equal to the expected 'y' value.  

Validation:  
By comparing the returned value of getY with the predefined 'y' value used during the initialization of the Address, this test confirms that getY reliably retrieves the correct 'y' coordinate. This is significant for correctly identifying the position of an Address in the context of a PetriDish, where spatial coordinates are critical.

**Scenario 2: Verify getY at Boundary Condition Min Y**

Details:  
TestName: getYAtMinimumBoundary  
Description: This test examines the behavior of the getY method when the Address instance is at the minimum 'y' boundary (0). It aims to verify that getY accurately reports boundary values, which are crucial in boundary condition testing in grid-like structures.

Execution:  
Arrange: Instantiate an Address with 'y' set to 0 (minimum boundary).  
Act: Call the getY method on this Address instance.  
Assert: Assert that the returned value is 0.  

Validation:  
Testing getY at the boundary condition ensures that the method handles minimum edge cases correctly, which is essential for avoiding errors during spatial calculations or iterations along the grid edges. It also ensures robustness in scenarios where addresses at the boundary are treated or assessed differently.

---

**Scenario 3: Verify getY at Boundary Condition Max Y**

Details:  
TestName: getYAtMaximumBoundary  
Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the getY method when the Address object is at the maximum 'y' boundary, determined by a specified 'size' limit in the PetriDish. Ensuring correct behavior at maximum boundaries is crucial for error-free grid navigation and operations.

Execution:  
Arrange: Construct an Address instance where 'y' equals 'size'-1 (assuming 'size' is an accessible upper boundary from the execution context, possibly a maximum grid size).  
Act: Retrieve the 'y' value using the getY method.  
Assert: Check that the returned value equals 'size' - 1.  

Validation:  
Confirming correct behavior at the maximum 'y' boundary ensures that Address instances on the edge of the grid are accurately represented and managed. This is critical for functions that depend on knowing edge limitations, such as generating neighbors or handling edge-specific rules.
