Scenario 1: Test default toString behavior for Address

Details:
  TestName: testDefaultToStringBehavior
  Description: This test checks the default string representation of an Address instance is correct as per the Address class' toString specification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Address instance with specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the resulting string matches the expected format "Address{x,y}".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the correct string representation of the Address instance which guarantees that our program will display Address entities accurately across the system. This is crucial for debugging output and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Test negative coordinates in toString

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNegativeCoordinates
  Description: This test verifies that the Address' toString method accurately handles negative coordinate values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with negative values for x and y.
  Act: Invoke the toString method of this Address object.
  Assert: Ensure that the output string contains these negative values properly formatted.
Validation:
  This scenario tests robust handling of negative coordinates, which may represent valid cases in a broader application context. The correct format of these addresses in logs and displays is essential for system accuracy and user communication.

Scenario 3: Test toString with boundary coordinate values

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithBoundaryValues
  Description: This test case ensures that toString method correctly reflects edge boundary values (like zero and possibly max integers).
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an Address object at boundaries, e.g., (0, 0) and (Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE).
  Act: Invoke toString on these objects.
  Assert: Verify the outputs are "Address{0,0}" and "Address{2147483647,2147483647}" respectively.
Validation:
  Verifying boundary values assures us that the Address communicates its state accurately under all possible legitimate input ranges. This might influence functions relying on address representations, such as mapping or boundary checks.

Scenario 4: ToString consistency with multiple calls

Details:
  TestName: testToStringMultipleConsistentCalls
  Description: Test if multiple invocations of toString on the same Address object yield consistent results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Address object with fixed coordinates.
  Act: Call toString multiple times on this object.
  Assert: All resulting strings from each call are identical.
Validation:
  Consistency across multiple method calls is necessary to ensure that object representation does not change over time, which is crucial when stored or logged multiple times in application lifecycle monitoring or debugging processes.

The errors provided do not indicate any issues directly associated with the `testDefaultToStringBehavior()` unit test code itself. However, they do reveal a few key areas of concern regarding the project's general configuration and compatibility issues that ultimately lead to build failure.

1. **Deprecated Dependency Version Warning**: The warning regarding the 'dependencies.dependency.version' for `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter` being set to 'LATEST' or 'RELEASE' suggests that the project's `pom.xml` file uses deprecated ways of declaring dependencies. This does not cause the build to fail immediately but is a potential risk for future compatibility and should be addressed by specifying a concrete version number.

2. **Java Version Compatibility Issue**: The critical error that leads to the build failure stems from a Java class file compatibility issue, specifically an "Unsupported class file major version 63". This error suggests that the code was compiled with a newer version of Java (likely Java 19, as indicated by the major version number 63 and the debug target 19 in the log) that is not supported by the version of the JaCoCo plugin being used. The JaCoCo plugin version `0.8.7` used here does not recognize or support this class file format introduced in newer Java versions.

The failure in generating the JaCoCo report, which is a code coverage report, makes the build process fail, but it does not directly relate to the logic or functionality of the `Address` class or the test method `testDefaultToStringBehavior()`. The test method itself appears to run correctly without any failures as indicated by the log `[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0`.

**Recommendation**: 
- Ensure that the Java version used to compile the project matches the supported versions for all plugins and dependencies used in the project. Verify and possibly update the JaCoCo plugin to a version that supports Java 19 if you want to use this Java version. Alternatively, consider compiling the project with an older supported Java version.
- Update the project's Maven configuration to use specific versions for dependencies instead of relying on 'LATEST' or 'RELEASE' for long-term stability and compatibility.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testDefaultToStringBehavior() {
    Address address = dummyPetriDish.new Address(5, 10);
    String expected = "Address{5,10}";
    assertEquals(expected, address.toString());
}

The provided test function `testToStringWithNegativeCoordinates` is intended to verify the correct string representation of an `Address` instance with negative coordinates. Based on the error trace and associated context, it appears that the test function itself is correct regarding structure and syntax. However, there are several other issues at play that contribute to the build failure, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Maven Dependencies Version Concerns**: The warnings about the 'dependencies.dependency.version' for `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar` being set to LATEST or RELEASE suggests a problem with how the project's dependencies are specified in the POM file. Maven versions starting from 3.0 deprecate the use of LATEST and RELEASE as versions because they can lead to unstable builds. This doesn't directly cause the test to fail but threatens the stability and reproducibility of the build.

2. **Unsupported class file major version**: The critical error that leads to the build failure is due to the Java version conflict, especially shown by `Unsupported class file major version 63`. This error is typical when a project is compiled with a version of Java that is newer than the version the tool (in this case, the JaCoCo plugin) can handle. The `major version 63` corresponds to Java 19, which suggests that the project sources are compiled using Java 19, while the versions of Maven and/or JaCoCo used do not support this Java version.

3. **Configuration issues**: The Maven build lifecycle outlines issues encountered during the resource, compile, test compile, and surefire plugin executions. Not setting the system modules path in conjunction with `-source 19` is again indicative of potential misconfiguration and mismatch between the JDK version used for compilation and the environment expected by the build tools.

In this case, even though the output of the test run sessions indicated no failures in test execution (`Failures: 0, Errors: 0`), the error that caused the build to fail is related to post-test execution during the report generation phase by JaCoCo. Therefore, to resolve this build failure and successfully run and evaluate the test:
- Confirm and align the JDK version for both compilation and tooling (like JaCoCo) to ensure compatibility.
- Update the Maven POM file to specify compatible tool and plugin versions and resolve the deprecated version warnings by setting specific versions instead of using LATEST or RELEASE.

Thus, the `testToStringWithNegativeCoordinates` function is not failing due to internal logic or assertion errors but due to an environmental and configuration issue related to Java version compatibility and Maven configuration.
@Test
@Tag("invalid")
public void testToStringWithNegativeCoordinates() {
    Address address = dummyPetriDish.new Address(-5, -10);
    String expected = "Address{-5,-10}";
    assertEquals(expected, address.toString());
}

/*
Based on the provided error logs and test function description, the test function `testToStringWithBoundaryValues()` itself is executing correctly during the test run phase as indicated by the log:
```
[INFO] Running com.solovev.model.AddressToStringTest
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.051 s - in com.solovev.model.AddressToStringTest
```
This suggests that the unit test you provided completes successfully with no errors or failures. The test checks the `toString()` method of the `Address` class with both boundary integer values (0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) and according to the logs, both assertions pass without issues.

The issue arises during the `BUILD FAILURE` phase specifically attributable to the JaCoCo maven plugin which is used for reporting code coverage:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project Bacteria: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation.
```
The specific error is related to the attempt to analyze compiled Java class files:
```
[ERROR] Error while analyzing /private/var/tmp/Roost/RoostGPT/java-customannotation-test/1729235311/source/Practice_Project_Bacteria/target/classes/com/solovev/model/PetriDish$Address.class. Unsupported class file major version 63 
```
This error is caused by the JaCoCo version used (`0.8.7`), which does not support the class file version produced by the JDK being used (probably JDK 19, given the class file version 63). The major version 63 corresponds to JDK 19. When the source code is compiled using JDK 19, JaCoCo 0.8.7 does not recognize this newer class file format, leading to analysis failure.

To summarize, the failure is not due to the test logic itself but rather due to a compatibility issue between the JDK version used for compiling the code and the version of JaCoCo used in the Maven build setup. To resolve this, either downgrade the JDK to a version compatible with JaCoCo 0.8.7 (e.g., JDK 17 or lower) or upgrade JaCoCo to a version that supports JDK 19.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testToStringWithBoundaryValues() {
    Address zeroAddress = dummyPetriDish.new Address(0, 0);
    Address maxAddress = dummyPetriDish.new Address(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    String expectedZero = "Address{0,0}";
    String expectedMax = "Address{2147483647,2147483647}";
    assertEquals(expectedZero, zeroAddress.toString());
    assertEquals(expectedMax, maxAddress.toString());
}

/*
The provided error logs suggest that the test `testToStringMultipleConsistentCalls` itself executes without any direct failures, errors or test skips, as indicated by the messages:
```
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.054 s - in com.solovev.model.AddressToStringTest
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```
This means that the test case completed successfully in terms of standard assertion evaluations with no test condition failing (both during setup and execution). Therefore, from a direct testing perspective of the business logic implemented in the `Address.toString()` method, there are no errors.

The real issue arises during the post-compilation and pre-reporting phases where JaCoCo, a code coverage library, attempts to analyze the class file (`PetriDish$Address.class`). The error message:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project Bacteria: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation
...
[ERROR] Unsupported class file major version 63
```
indicates that JaCoCo cannot handle the class file format. The "Unsupported class file major version 63" essentially points out a version discrepancy. Usually, each major version of the Java class file format corresponds to a version of the Java SDK. Java 19 corresponds to major version 63, which suggests that the class files are compiled using Java 19. However, the JaCoCo version used (0.8.7) does not support Java 19, leading to this issue.

This problem is not associated directly with the logical implementation of the test or the application's business logic but rather with the tools and environment setup. The solution to this issue would involve either upgrading JaCoCo to a version that supports Java 19 or changing the Java SDK version used for compilation to a version supported by JaCoCo 0.8.7. Alternatively, adjusting compiler settings might be required to ensure compatibility.

Thus, the test function `testToStringMultipleConsistentCalls` doesn’t fail due to any faults in the code logic or test assertions but encounters environmental issues related to tool support for the JDK version used during development.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testToStringMultipleConsistentCalls() {
    Address address = dummyPetriDish.new Address(15, 20);
    String resultOne = address.toString();
    String resultTwo = address.toString();
    String resultThree = address.toString();
    assertEquals(resultOne, resultTwo);
    assertEquals(resultOne, resultThree);
}
