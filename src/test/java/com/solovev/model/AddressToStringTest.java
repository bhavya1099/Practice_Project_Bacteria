Scenario 1: Verify correct toString output for typical Address values

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithTypicalValues
  Description: This test checks that the toString method correctly formats the string with typical x and y values for an address. This is to ensure the method accurately represents the state of the object in a human-readable form.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with typical integer values for x and y.
  Act: Call the toString method on the Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the resulting string matches the expected format "Address{x,y}".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion verifies that the Address instance is converted into a string in the specified format, ensuring that the toString method functions as designed.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Correct implementation of toString helps in logging and debugging processes by providing a clear and concise representation of the object state.

Scenario 2: Verify toString output for edge-case Address values (minimum coordinates)

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithMinimumCoordinates
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method appropriately formats the string when the address has the minimal possible x and y values (0, 0). This checks the method's robustness in handling edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with x = 0 and y = 0.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that the output string is "Address{0,0}".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This checks that the method can correctly format the string even with boundary values for coordinates.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring accurate behavior with boundary inputs ensures the robustness and reliability of the method under various scenarios.

Scenario 3: Verify toString with negative coordinates

Details:
  TestName: verifyToStringWithNegativeCoordinates
  Description: Evaluates the behavior of the toString method when provided with negative values for x and y. This test is crucial for understanding how the method handles unconventional yet possible input scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with x = -1 and y = -1.
  Act: Call the toString method on this Address instance.
  Assert: Check if the resulting string is "Address{-1,-1}".
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test checks that negative values are accurately represented in the string, which is significant for debugging and validation in scenarios involving map navigation or spatial representations that might temporarily use negative coordinates.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in terms of application behavior or logic. Ensuring that the method can handle and correctly represent negative values is crucial for applications that might deal with coordinate transformations or systems where negative coordinates temporarily exist.
