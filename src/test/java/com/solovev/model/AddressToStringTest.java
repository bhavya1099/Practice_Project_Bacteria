### Scenario 1: Test `toString` on a Normal Address Instance

Details:
TestName: verifyToStringStandardAddress
Description: This test verifies that the `toString` method of the `Address` class correctly formats the string representation of an address with reasonable `x` and `y` coordinates, ensuring the output matches the expected "Address{x,y}" structure.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an `Address` instance with specific coordinate values (e.g., `x=5`, `y=10`).
  - Act: Call the `toString` method on the created instance.
  - Assert: Check if the output string matches `"Address{5,10}"`.

Validation:
  - This assertion verifies that the `toString` method correctly constructs the string representation of the `Address` instance with the given coordinates. It is crucial for debugging and logging purposes to ensure the `toString` output is precisely as expected.

### Scenario 2: Test `toString` with Negative Coordinates

Details:
TestName: verifyToStringWithNegativeCoordinates
Description: Test to ensure that the `toString` method provides the correct string even when the `Address` instance has negative coordinates.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an `Address` instance where `x` and/or `y` are negative (e.g., `x=-3`, `y=-9`).
  - Act: Invoke the `toString` method on the created instance.
  - Assert: Confirm the output string matches `"Address{-3,-9}"`.

Validation:
  - This test checks if `toString` can accurately handle negative values, which is important for scenarios where `Address` could represent points below a certain reference, e.g., in simulations involving multiple quadrants or custom coordinate systems.

### Scenario 3: Test `toString` at Coordinate Origins

Details:
TestName: verifyToStringAtCoordinatesOrigin
Description: Ensure that the `toString` method outputs correctly when the `Address` instance represents the origin point (0,0).

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an `Address` with `x=0` and `y=0`.
  - Act: Call the `toString` method on it.
  - Assert: Check if the output equals `"Address{0,0}"`.

Validation:
  - This test ensures that `toString` correctly formats the string for an `Address` at the origin, which is a common reference point in many applications and must be represented accurately.

### Scenario 4: Test `toString` on Address with Maximum Integer Values

Details:
TestName: verifyToStringWithMaxIntValues
Description: Tests how the `toString` method handles extremely large integer values for coordinates, representing potential edge cases in position representation.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an `Address` using the maximum integer value for both `x` and `y` (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
  - Act: Trigger `toString` on this instance.
  - Assert: Verify that the string output matches `"Address{2147483647,2147483647}"`.

Validation:
  - This test checks `toString` functionality under extreme conditions, ensuring that it effectively handles `Address` instances with large coordinate values which can occur in large scale environments or systems with significant data ranges.

These test scenarios comprehensively examine the robustness and accuracy of the `toString` method in different situational contexts for `Address` instances.

/*
The test failure in the provided scenario is not specifically related to the logic of the test case itself but a result of an issue encountered during the build and reporting phase of running the tests. The error explicitly states that there is a problem with the JaCoCo plugin's report generation. The root of this error is the use of an unsupported class file version (major version 63), which signifies the class files are compiled using a newer Java version that is not supported by the version of JaCoCo being used (`0.8.7`).

The stack trace from Maven's report indicates:
```plaintext
[ERROR] org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project Bacteria: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation.: Error while creating report: Error while analyzing /private/var/tmp/Roost/RoostGPT/java-customannotation-test/1729245071/source/Practice_Project_Bacteria/target/classes/com/solovev/model/PetriDish$Address.class. Unsupported class file major version 63
```
Here, "Unsupported class file major version 63" tells us that the Java version used to compile the classes (likely Java 19) is not compatible with the JaCoCo plugin version used in the project. In this case, updating the JaCoCo plugin to a version that supports Java 19 would likely resolve this issue.

The test function `verifyToStringStandardAddress` actually passed without errors or failures as indicated:
```plaintext
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```
This suggests that the `toString` method and the class structure—including constructor calls and the building of the Address instance—are working correctly as intended within the test.

Therefore, the failure in the build is solely due to the Maven plugin incompatibility with the more recent Java class file format version and does not imply a failure in the actual unit test logic or set-up. This indicates an environment or configuration issue rather than a problem with the test code itself. To resolve it, one should look into updating the JaCoCo plugin or verify the Java and plugin versions to ensure compatibility.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void verifyToStringStandardAddress() {
    // Assuming PetriDish class is a valid
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    // enclosing class for Address
    Address address = petriDish.new Address(5, 10);
    assertEquals("Address{5,10}", address.toString(), "The string representation does not match the expected format.");

The log snippets provided detail the output from a Maven build process, including both the build steps and the errors encountered during the build and tests. From the provided logs, it's imperative to note a few critical elements that contribute to the understanding of why certain issues might be occurring:

1. **Maven Dependencies Warning**:
   The log mentions a warning regarding the use of 'LATEST' or 'RELEASE' as versions for a dependency, specifically `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter`. This approach is deprecated because it can lead to unstable builds due to changing dependencies. While this is not directly causing a test failure, it is not best practice and could potentially cause issues in more dynamic environments or during dependency resolution.

2. **Unsupported Class File Major Version**:
   The primary error causing the build failure appears at the testing phase, specifically when trying to generate a report using the JaCoCo plugin. The error message indicates an "Unsupported class file major version 63," which suggests that the Java class files were compiled using a Java version not supported by the current tool chain or runtime environment used in this Maven configuration. In Java, major version 63 corresponds to Java 19. If the tools used (like an older version of the JaCoCo plugin or the Maven Compiler Plugin) do not support Java 19, they will fail to read the class files, causing the build to fail.

3. **Contextual Misalignment in Test Description**:
   The provided test function aims to verify the `toString` implementation for negative coordinates in the `Address` class. However, there's nothing in the logs indicating a failure specific to this test's logic. The output of the test run sessions states `Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0`, which indicates that all unit tests, including the one provided, executed successfully without any logical assertion failures or runtime exceptions.

The pertinent issue here stems from version compatibility, particularly with Java 19 class files not being supported by the JaCoCo plugin used for report generation. To resolve this failure, you would need to ensure that all tools in the build process, including the Java compiler, Maven itself, and plugins like JaCoCo, are updated to versions that support Java 19. Additionally, fixing the Maven warning about dependency versioning is recommended to stabilize the build environment.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void verifyToStringWithNegativeCoordinates() {
    // Assuming PetriDish class is a valid
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    // enclosing class for Address
    Address address = petriDish.new Address(-3, -9);
    assertEquals("Address{-3,-9}", address.toString(), "The string representation should correctly handle negative values.");
}

The error encountered while running the provided Java unit test is not directly due to a failure in the test logic or an assertion failure. Instead, the issue is related to a failure in the JaCoCo Maven plugin used for code coverage reporting during the build process.

The specific error message,
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project Bacteria: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation.: Error while creating report: Error while analyzing [...]/PetriDish$Address.class. Unsupported class file major version 63
```
indicates that the JaCoCo tool is unable to handle a class file compiled for Java version 19, as denoted by the "major version 63". This error suggests that the version of JaCoCo being used (0.8.7) does not support the Java version used to compile the classes (Java 19 in this scenario).

This type of error typically arises when project dependencies are not aligned with the JDK version. In this case, the JaCoCo version is not compatible with Java 19's class file format. To resolve this issue:
- You could downgrade the JDK used for compiling the source code to a version that is supported by JaCoCo 0.8.7.
- Alternatively, you can upgrade to a newer version of JaCoCo that supports Java 19. For example, a later version might have added support for handling the newer class file formats.

This issue is not related to the test code itself, so the unit test function `verifyToStringAtCoordinatesOrigin()` should function correctly when the build and reporting tools are configured to align with the Java version used in the project.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void verifyToStringAtCoordinatesOrigin() {
    // Assuming PetriDish class is a valid
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    // enclosing class for Address
    Address address = petriDish.new Address(0, 0);
    assertEquals("Address{0,0}", address.toString(), "The string representation for the origin coordinate does not match the expected output.");
}

The provided error logs indicate a build failure during a Maven project build, specifically during the phase of JaCoCo report generation. The critical error here states, "Unsupported class file major version 63." This error pops up when the Java compiler generates class files that a tool (here, JaCoCo) cannot understand due to the classes being compiled with newer features introduced in a Java version that is not supported by the tool.

Version 63 of the class file format corresponds to Java 19. The error suggests that the project was compiled with Java 19 (possibly due to the configured Maven compiler plugin) but JaCoCo, version 0.8.7 used in the project, does not recognize this newer class file format, as it might not have support for Java 19 at this moment.

For the test function specifically (`verifyToStringWithMaxIntValues`), there are no direct indications in the logs that the function itself failed due to logical errors in assertions or in setting up objects. The primary issue causing the build to fail centers around compatibility between Java versions and the Jacoco plugin version used.

To remedy this situation:
- Consider downgrading the project's Java version to match the highest Java version supported by JaCoCo.
- Alternatively, upgrade JaCoCo to a version (if available) that supports class file major version 63, which would correspond to Java 19. 

These steps should resolve the build failure and allow the Maven project to compile and generate the JaCoCo test coverage report successfully.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void verifyToStringWithMaxIntValues() {
    // Assuming PetriDish class is a valid
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    // enclosing class for Address
    Address address = petriDish.new Address(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    assertEquals("Address{2147483647,2147483647}", address.toString(), "The string representation should handle the maximum integer values correctly.");
