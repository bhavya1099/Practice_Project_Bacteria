Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `getX()` method in the `Address` class.

---

**Scenario 1: Get X Coordinate of Address When X is Positive**

Details:
  TestName: getXWhenXIsPositive
  Description: This test checks that the getX() method returns the correct x-coordinate value when the x property of the Address is set to a positive integer.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with a positive x value.
  Act: Call the getX() method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the initial x-coordinate value set during the arrangement.
  
Validation:
  Clarify: The assertion verifies that the X value retrieved by getX() is identical to the one with which the Address object was initialized.
  Elaborate: Ensures that getX() accurately reflects the x property of an address, crucial for correctly identifying the location horizontally.

**Scenario 2: Get X Coordinate When X is Zero**

Details:
  TestName: getXWhenXIsZero
  Description: Checks if the getX() method fetches correctly when the x coordinate is explicitly set to zero, which is a boundary condition.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Address with x set to 0.
  Act: Invoke the getX() method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0.
  
Validation:
  Clarify: The test confirms getX() handles and returns '0' accurately, indicating no displacement along the x-axis from the origin.
  Elaborate: Critical for applications where initializing at the origin is a valid scenario, ensuring reliability in edge case handling.

**Scenario 3: Get X Coordinate of Default Address Initialization**

Details:
  TestName: getXForDefaultInitialization
  Description: Checks the return of getX() when an Address object is initialized with default constructor values if such a constructor exists.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an Address using default values assuming a constructor exists that sets x somehow, or it defaults to a Java primitive default.
  Act: Call getX() method.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value is the default Java initialization for an int (which is 0).
  
Validation:
  Clarify: Ensures that getX() yields '0' when no specific initialization is provided, adhering to Java's default values.
  Elaborate: Validates that Address objects not explicitly initialized still behave predictably, important for avoiding unintended behaviors in larger systems.

**Scenario 4: Get X Coordinate on Max Integer Boundary**

Details:
  TestName: getXAtMaxIntegerValue
  Description: Tests if the getX() method correctly returns the maximum possible integer value for x.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Address object with x set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  Act: Call getX().
  Assert: Check if the returned value equals Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  
Validation:
  Clarify: Confirms that getX() can handle and return extreme positive integer values accurately.
  Elaborate: Important for systems that might deal with very large values ensuring that the application can handle all legitimate int values without error.

**Scenario 5: Get X Coordinate Consistency Check**

Details:
  TestName: getXConsistencyCheck
  Description: Verifies that multiple calls to getX() return consistent results, ensuring that the x property does not change over reads.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Address with an arbitrary x value, say 15.
  Act: Call getX() multiple times.
  Assert: Ensure all calls return the same value.
  
Validation:
  Clarify: The assertion ensures the immutability or consistent read-only nature of the x property via the getX() method.
  Elaborate: This is essential for ensuring data integrity throughout the lifecycle of the Address object within application flows.

---

These scenarios should cover various facets of how the `getX()` method handles different kinds and ranges of input, and how it performs under different conditions, ensuring comprehensive testing of this method.
