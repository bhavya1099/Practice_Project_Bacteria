### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test

**Details:**
- TestName: getXBasicFunctionality
- Description: This test verifies whether the getX method returns the expected x-coordinate value of the Address object.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a specific x-value, e.g., 5.
- Act: Call the getX method on the created instance.
- Assert: Verify if the returned x-value is the same as the value used during object creation.

**Validation:**
- Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks whether the getX method correctly retrieves the x-value that is set in the Address instance during its initialization.
- Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Ensuring that the getX method returns the correct x-coordinate value is crucial for accurate placement and identification of the Address within the larger context (likely a grid or map).

### Scenario 2: Consistency Check Across Multiple Invocations

**Details:**
- TestName: getXConsistencyCheck
- Description: This test assesses whether multiple calls to getX on the same object return consistent results.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create an Address instance with a known x-value.
- Act: Call the getX method on this instance multiple times (e.g., three times).
- Assert: Compare all returned values to ensure they are identical and correct.

**Validation:**
- Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test checks for the consistency of the getX method over multiple invocations, ensuring the method's reliability.
- Elaborate on the significance: Repeated method calls should return the same result if the object's state hasn't changed. This consistency is vital for applications that may rely on frequent readings of the same property.

---

### Scenario 3: Verification With Edge Values

**Details:**
- TestName: getXWithEdgeValues
- Description: Validate that getX handles and returns extreme values (e.g., Integer's minimum and maximum values) correctly.

**Execution:**
- Arrange: Create two Address instances, one with x set to Integer.MIN_VALUE and another to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
- Act: Invoke getX on both instances.
- Assert: Check if the returned values match the set extreme values for each instance.

**Validation:**
- Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test ensures that getX can handle and return the edge integer values accurately, which might be critical in edge-cases handling in the application.
- Elaborate on the significance: Correct handling and return of edge values in getX are vital for robustness, especially in scenarios involving large or comprehensive datasets that might reach these extremes.

---

These scenarios effectively cover the basic functionality and some critical edge cases for the getX method, ensuring it behaves as expected under various ordinary and extraordinary circumstances.
