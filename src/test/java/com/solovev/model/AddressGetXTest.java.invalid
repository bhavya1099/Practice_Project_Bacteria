**Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of the x-coordinate**

Details:  
  TestName: getXBasicTest  
  Description: This test checks if the getX() method correctly returns the x-coordinate of the Address.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with specified x and y coordinates.  
  Act: Call the getX() method on the Address instance.  
  Assert: Verify that the returned x-coordinate matches the one used during the construction.  
Validation:  
  - The assertion verifies that the getX() method should return the exact x-coordinate that was set during object initialization.  
  - Essential to ensure that object properties are accurately retrieved, providing confidence in the integrity of data handling within the application.

**Scenario 2: negative x-coordinate retrieval**

Details:  
  TestName: getXNegativeCoordinateTest  
  Description: Assesses the functionality of getX() when the Address is instantiated with a negative x-coordinate.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with a negative x-coordinate and any y-coordinate.  
  Act: Invoke getX() on the created Address instance.  
  Assert: The obtained x-coordinate should match the initial negative value.  
Validation:  
  - This test confirms that getX() accurately retrieves negative values, indicating robustness in handling diverse coordinate ranges.  
  - Important for applications where negative coordinates might represent valid data, such as in simulations or certain types of grid systems.

**Scenario 3: Maximum integer x-coordinate retrieval**

Details:  
  TestName: getXMaximumIntTest  
  Description: Ensures that the getX() method correctly handles and returns the maximum integer value for the x-coordinate.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Initialize an Address instance with Integer.MAX_VALUE as x and any valid y-coordinate.  
  Act: Call getX() on this instance.  
  Assert: Check that the returned value is Integer.MAX_VALUE.  
Validation:  
  - Validates the capability of getX() to handle and return the largest possible integer, critical for avoiding data truncation or overflow errors.
  - Significant in contexts where the coordinate system must accommodate a wide range of values, ensuring system scalability and reliability.

**Scenario 4: Conformance to Object equality**

Details:  
  TestName: getXEqualityCheckTest  
  Description: Verifies that the value retrieved by getX() is consistent across different instances of Address with the same x-coordinate.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Generate two different Address instances with the same x-coordinate and different y-coordinates.  
  Act: Extract the x-coordinate from both instances using getX().  
  Assert: Confirm that both x-coordinates are equal.  
Validation:  
  - Asserts that getX() remains consistent and is unaffected by changes in other properties (like y-coordinate), which is imperative for correct behavior in data manipulations based on x-coordinates.
  - This test highlights the reliability and isolative functioning of property accessors in multi-property objects, ensuring individual property integrity.

These scenarios comprehensively evaluate the functionality of the getX() method under various conditions, ensuring its robustness and reliability.
