ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getX_c85440c7a8

**Scenario 1: Basic retrieval of the x-coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getXBasicTest
  Description: Validates that the getX method accurately retrieves the x-coordinate of the Address instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate.
  Act: Call the getX() method on the instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned x-coordinate equals the initial value set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getX method correctly returns the initial x-coordinate value set upon instantiation of the Address object. It confirms the method's capability to correctly access and return the x field, ensuring the method's reliability for coordinate retrieval.

---

**Scenario 2: Consistency of getX result**

Details:  
  TestName: getXConsistencyCheck
  Description: Ensures that repeated calls to getX return consistent results, confirming no side effects or state changes occur within the getX method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with a specific x-coordinate.
  Act: Call the getX method multiple times on the same object.
  Assert: Ensure all results are identical and match the initial x-coordinate.
Validation:
  Validating the consistency of getX results on successive calls helps confirm the absence of side effects within the method. This is crucial for the predictability and reliability of system components that rely on stable coordinate values.

---

**Scenario 3: Negative x-coordinate handling**

Details:  
  TestName: getXWithNegativeCoordinate
  Description: Checks the behavior of the getX method when the Address object is initialized with a negative x-coordinate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object with a negative x-value.
  Act: Retrieve the x-coordinate using getX.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value matches the negative number set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the getX method accurately handles and returns negative integers, which might represent addresses in a grid with origins or other specific use cases. It validates the robustness of the method in handling diverse input scenarios.

---

**Scenario 4: Verify getX with zero coordinate**

Details:  
  TestName: getXWithZeroCoordinate
  Description: Examines the behavior of getX when initializing an Address object at the origin point (0 coordinate).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with x-coordinate set to zero.
  Act: Call getX to retrieve the x-coordinate.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test confirms that getX accurately handles and returns a coordinate of zero, essential for scenarios where the Address might represent origin or base positions in a coordinate system.

---

**Scenario 5: Boundary value response**

Details:  
  TestName: getXBoundaryValueTest
  Description: Assesses the response of getX at potential boundary values of the x-coordinate based on system or application constraints.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object with a very high or maximum integer value for the x-coordinate.
  Act: Retrieve the x-value using getX.
  Assert: Ensure the returned value matches the extreme boundary value used in the setup.
Validation:
  Validates that getX can handle and return very high or boundary integer values correctly. This test is critical in verifying system behavior under extreme conditions, ensuring reliability and robustness.
