Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `getY()` method in the `Address` class:

---

**Scenario 1: Verify Y Coordinate Retrieval for Valid Initialized Address**

Details:
  TestName: getYForValidInitialization
  Description: This test checks if the `getY()` method correctly retrieves the Y coordinate of the address when it is properly initialized with a valid integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class initialized with specific X and Y coordinates.
  Act: Call the `getY()` method on the initialized Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result from `getY()` matches the initialized Y coordinate.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the integrity of the object's state and ensure that the Y value retrieval is consistent with the assigned value during object initialization. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality needed to ensure reliability in spatial calculations and address manipulations within the system.

---

**Scenario 2: Verify Y Coordinate Retrieval at Boundary Condition (Zero)**

Details:
  TestName: getYAtBoundaryZero
  Description: Tests whether the `getY()` method can accurately retrieve a Y coordinate of zero, which represents a boundary condition in a grid or coordinate system.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Address object at the origin (0,0).
  Act: Invoke `getY()` on this Address instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned Y coordinate is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that `getY()` correctly handles boundary values, particularly the lower boundary of a typical grid or coordinate system. It is essential for ensuring that address handling logic remains robust even at the extremities of possible values.

---

**Scenario 3: Verify Y Coordinate Retrieval at Maximum Integer Value**

Details:
  TestName: getYAtMaxIntegerValue
  Description: Validates the `getY()` method when the Address is initialized at the maximum integer value for the Y coordinate, testing the upper limits of coordinate handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with Y set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and any valid X coordinate.
  Act: Call `getY()` on this instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the result matches `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
Validation:
  Checking the getAddress method at the maximum integer value ensures that the system can manage addresses at the highest possible Y-coordinate. This scenario is crucial for applications with large data sets or needing to operate at the extreme ends of value limits, ensuring the system's reliability and scalability.

---

These scenarios comprehensively cover the functionality of the `getY()` method across typical use cases and boundary conditions, ensuring robustness and correctness in its implementation.
