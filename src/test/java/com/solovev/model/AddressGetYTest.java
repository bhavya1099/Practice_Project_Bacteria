**Scenario 1: Verify getY for Valid Positive Coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getYForValidPositiveCoordinate
  Description: This test checks that the getY method returns the correct Y-coordinate when a positive value is assigned during the instantiation of the Address class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a specific positive y value.
  Act: Invoke getY on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Y-value is equal to the value used at instantiation.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the getY method correctly returns the Y-coordinate provided at the object's construction. It guarantees that our program can reliably retrieve part of an object's state, ensuring data integrity.

**Scenario 2: Verify getY for Zero Coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getYForZeroCoordinate
  Description: This test checks that the getY method returns zero when the Y-coordinate of the Address is set to zero during instantiation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with y set to zero.
  Act: Invoke getY on the created instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Y-value is zero.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that getY handles and returns zero accurately, which is significant for cases where boundaries or initial states in grid-like structures are being tested, such as the likely edge of a petri dish simulation.

**Scenario 3: Verify getY for Negative Coordinate**

Details:
  TestName: getYForNegativeCoordinate
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getY method when a negative value is used for the Y-coordinate during instantiation. Ideally, negative coordinates should be handled appropriately or avoided if not expected in the business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a negative y.
  Act: Invoke getY on this instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Y-value matches the negative value initially set.
Validation:
  The validation confirms whether the Address class can hold and return negative values for Y-coordinates. This test could serve to notify developers of unintended data types/values and encourage constraints or validations in the class's setters or constructors.

**Scenario 4: Verify getY with Maximum Integer Boundary**

Details:
  TestName: getYWithMaxIntBoundary
  Description: Test if the getY method can correctly handle and return the maximum possible integer value for a Y-coordinate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with Integer.MAX_VALUE as y.
  Act: Invoke getY on this instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned Y-value equals Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Validation:
  This test checks boundary handling for getY, ensuring that extremely high values are managed without error, which is crucial for resilience and stability of the system in various operational contexts.

By testing these diverse scenarios, we can verify that getY behaves as expected across a range of valid and boundary values, providing confidence in the robustness and reliability of this method.
