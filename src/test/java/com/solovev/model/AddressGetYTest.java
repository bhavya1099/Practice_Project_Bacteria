**Scenario 1: Y Value at Origin**

Details:
TestName: getYAtOrigin
Description: This test verifies if the getY method correctly returns the 'y' coordinate when an Address is at the origin (0,0). Typically, the origin is a critical boundary condition in coordinate-based systems.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an instance of Address set at (0,0).
  - Act: Invoke the getY method on this instance.
  - Assert: Check whether the result returned by getY is 0.

Validation:
  - The assertion verifies that the getY method accurately retrieves the 'y' coordinate of the Address instance. Given that the origin (0,0) in many grid systems represents a cornerstone scenario, it's crucial to ensure correctness at this point. The expected result is 0, confirming the correct managing of coordinates by the Address class.

**Scenario 2: Positive Y Value**

Details:
TestName: fetchPositiveY
Description: Tests if the getY method returns the correct 'y' coordinate for an Address initialized with a positive y-value (e.g., 5). Positive values are common and must be handled correctly.

Execution:
  - Arrange: instantiate Address with y-value set to 5.
  - Act: Invoke the getY method on this instance.
  - Assert: Check if the returned y-value is 5.

Validation:
  - This assertion ensures the getY function correctly reads 'y' values that are positive, which forms a substantial part of the usual range for coordinates. Correct handling of positive coordinates assures that the Address can represent real-world locations on a positive quadrant or entire grid.

---

**Scenario 3: Maximum Integer Y Value**

Details:
TestName: getYAtIntegerMax
Description: Checks if the getY method can correctly handle and return the maximum integer value. This is an edge case for testing the robustness with extreme positive values.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Initialize Address with y set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
  - Act: Call getY.
  - Assert: Verify that the getY call returns Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Validation:
  - This scenario confirms that getY handles and returns integer's maximum limit. This is critical for ensuring the Address can deal with extreme cases without data overflow or errors, thus maintaining reliability and data integrity.

---

**Scenario 4: Negative Y Value**

Details:
TestName: fetchNegativeY
Description: Tests if the getY method correctly returns negative values, which might represent scenarios or special cases in certain systems where negative coordinates are valid.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an Address instance with y = -3.
  - Act: Call getY().
  - Assert: Ensure the returned value is -3.

Validation:
  - This test scenario validates handling and correct retrieval of negative y-values. Negative values, while unusual, might represent valid situations (like underground mapping or specific scientific modeling), thus important to confirm correct behavior.

---

These test scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases for the getAddress method, ensuring it performs correctly in various circumstances and validates alignments with the expected behaviors in a coordinate system modeled by the Address class. All scenarios are essential for both functional correctness and boundary testing.
