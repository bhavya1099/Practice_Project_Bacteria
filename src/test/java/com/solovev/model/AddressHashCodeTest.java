"""
Scenario 1: Consistent hashCode for same object

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyCheck
  Description: Ensure that calling the hashCode method on the same Address object multiple times returns the same integer each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address instance more than once.
  Assert: Check if the hashCodes from each invocation match.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The consistency of the hashCode computation according to Java contract which guarantees the same hashCode for multiple invocations during an execution of a Java application when the object doesn't change.
  Elaborate on significance: Ensures that the Address object can be reliably used in hash-based collections like HashMap or HashSet without the risk of misplacing entries due to varying hashCodes.

"""

"""
Scenario 2: Different hashCodes for different object coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeUniquenessCheck
  Description: Verify that two Address objects with different x or y coordinates produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with different x and/or y coordinates.
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for each of the Address instances.
  Assert: Compare the hashCodes to assert they are not equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensuring that two distinct Address objects are likely to have different hashCodes to reduce collision probability in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on significance: Helps in efficiently parsing through collections like HashSet or HashMap where a lower collision rate ensures better performance.

"""

"""
Scenario 3: Same hashCodes for two objects with mirrored coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeMirrorCoordinates
  Description: Ensure that two Address objects with interchanged x and y coordinates produce the same hashCode if the hash function depends symmetrically on x and y.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects where the first has coordinates (x, y) and the second has coordinates (y, x).
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for both instances.
  Assert: Compare the calculated hashCodes to confirm that they match.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Depending on the hash implementation details, if the hash is calculated symmetrically respecting both dimensions equally, then mirrored coordinates might give same hashCode which could lead to intended or unintended bucket collisions in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on significance: Understanding how the Address's hashCode deals with symmetry can impact the design of collections that might need specific behaviors like coordinate-based grouping or distinction.

"""

"""
Scenario 4: Same hashCodes for identical object coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIdenticalObjects
  Description: Validate that two distinct Address objects with the same x and y coordinates yield the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Address object both initialized with the same x and y coordinates.
  Act: Obtain the hashCode from both Address instances.
  Assert: Assert that both hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: That Address objects representing the same point in space are considered equal in terms of hashCode as required by the general contract of hashCode where equal objects must produce the same hash code.
  Elaborate on significance: Important for maintaining consistency and reliability when Address instances are used in hashing structures, ensuring that equal objects are treated as such in Maps and Sets.
