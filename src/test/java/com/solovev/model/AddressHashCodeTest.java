"""
Scenario 1: Consistent hashCode for same object

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyCheck
  Description: Ensure that calling the hashCode method on the same Address object multiple times returns the same integer each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address instance more than once.
  Assert: Check if the hashCodes from each invocation match.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The consistency of the hashCode computation according to Java contract which guarantees the same hashCode for multiple invocations during an execution of a Java application when the object doesn't change.
  Elaborate on significance: Ensures that the Address object can be reliably used in hash-based collections like HashMap or HashSet without the risk of misplacing entries due to varying hashCodes.

"""

"""
Scenario 2: Different hashCodes for different object coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeUniquenessCheck
  Description: Verify that two Address objects with different x or y coordinates produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Address class with different x and/or y coordinates.
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for each of the Address instances.
  Assert: Compare the hashCodes to assert they are not equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensuring that two distinct Address objects are likely to have different hashCodes to reduce collision probability in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on significance: Helps in efficiently parsing through collections like HashSet or HashMap where a lower collision rate ensures better performance.

"""

"""
Scenario 3: Same hashCodes for two objects with mirrored coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeMirrorCoordinates
  Description: Ensure that two Address objects with interchanged x and y coordinates produce the same hashCode if the hash function depends symmetrically on x and y.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects where the first has coordinates (x, y) and the second has coordinates (y, x).
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for both instances.
  Assert: Compare the calculated hashCodes to confirm that they match.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Depending on the hash implementation details, if the hash is calculated symmetrically respecting both dimensions equally, then mirrored coordinates might give same hashCode which could lead to intended or unintended bucket collisions in hash-based collections.
  Elaborate on significance: Understanding how the Address's hashCode deals with symmetry can impact the design of collections that might need specific behaviors like coordinate-based grouping or distinction.

"""

"""
Scenario 4: Same hashCodes for identical object coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeIdenticalObjects
  Description: Validate that two distinct Address objects with the same x and y coordinates yield the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Address object both initialized with the same x and y coordinates.
  Act: Obtain the hashCode from both Address instances.
  Assert: Assert that both hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: That Address objects representing the same point in space are considered equal in terms of hashCode as required by the general contract of hashCode where equal objects must produce the same hash code.
  Elaborate on significance: Important for maintaining consistency and reliability when Address instances are used in hashing structures, ensuring that equal objects are treated as such in Maps and Sets.

/*
The provided test function `hashCodeUniquenessCheck()` is aimed at checking whether two instances of the `Address` class with slightly different properties give different hash codes, which is a common test for the `hashCode` implementation.

After analyzing the build and test execution logs provided, it appears that the unit test itself did not fail in assertion or have any exceptions directly relating to test logic. In fact, the logs from the `surefire` plugin indicate that tests run successfully (`Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0`).

The failure reported is not directly related to the execution of the unit test logic but to the JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) report generation phase. The error stems from a JVM compatibility issue specifically indicated by `Unsupported class file major version 63`. This error tells us that the class files were compiled with a Java version that is not supported by the version of the JaCoCo tool configured in this Maven project.

The error message `Unsupported class file major version 63` suggests that the code was compiled with a version of Java newer than what JaCoCo supports in the configuration used. Java class file major version 63 corresponds to Java 19, indicating that the project code is compiled with Java 19.

To resolve this issue, one should adjust either the Java version used for compiling the code to one that's compatible with the current JaCoCo version or update the JaCoCo plugin to a version that supports Java 19. This issue is a setup/configuration problem and is unrelated to the correctness or functionality of the unit tests or `hashCode()` method implementation.

public void hashCodeUniquenessCheck() {

    Address address2 = petriDish.new Address(4, 5);

    int hashCode2 = address2.hashCode();
    assertNotEquals(hashCode1, hashCode2, "Hashcodes should be different for different addresses");
}

/*
The failure of the `hashCodeMirrorCoordinates` test function primarily arises from the misunderstanding or inaccurate expectation regarding the hash code computation for the objects of the `Address` class with symmetric coordinates. The hash code method implemented in the `Address` class is likely something similar to `Objects.hash(x, y)`. This method computes hash codes based on the order of the given arguments, hence `Objects.hash(3, 5)` will not equal `Objects.hash(5, 3)`.

In the test function `hashCodeMirrorCoordinates`, the expectation—asserted by `assertEquals(hashCode1, hashCode2)`—is that the hash codes of two addresses should be the same when their coordinates `(3, 5)` and `(5, 3)` are simple mirror reflections of each other on the line `y = x`. However, the default hash computation does not recognize symmetry in this manner unless explicitly defined to do so. As the result shows, the actual computed hash codes `1059` for `(3, 5)` and `1119` for `(5, 3)` are different, which correctly reflects the default behavior of the `Objects.hash()` method. The failure is thus due to an incorrect assumption in the test that the hash code implementation supports symmetric coordinates, which it currently does not.

To correct this, one needs to either adjust the expectation within the test (not expecting symmetric coordinates to yield the same hash) or alter the `hashCode()` implementation in the `Address` class to account for symmetric scenarios (e.g., by computing the hash on sorted values of `x` and `y`). This particular test scenario is failing because of a misalignment between assumed and actual behavior of the `hashCode` method concerning coordinate symmetry.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void hashCodeMirrorCoordinates() {
    Address address1 = petriDish.new Address(3, 5);
    Address address2 = petriDish.new Address(5, 3);
    int hashCode1 = address1.hashCode();
    int hashCode2 = address2.hashCode();
    // TODO: Modify assertion based on the expected symmetry behavior
    assertEquals(hashCode1, hashCode2, "Hashcodes should be the same for symmetric coordinates if hash is symmetric");
}

/*
The unit test `hashCodeIdenticalObjects` is designed to verify the correct implementation of the `hashCode` method in the `Address` class, ensuring that two `Address` instances with the same `x` and `y` values produce the same hash code. However, the failure described in the logs does not appear to originate from the logic within the unit test itself but from a broader Maven build process issue related to the JaCoCo plugin.

The key error in the logs is:
```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.7:report (report) on project Bacteria: An error has occurred in JaCoCo report generation.: Error while creating report: Error while analyzing /private/var/tmp/Roost/RoostGPT/java-customannotation-test/1729235311/source/Practice_Project_Bacteria/target/classes/com/solovev/model/PetriDish$Address.class. Unsupported class file major version 63
```

This error message indicates a compatibility issue between the Java class file version (version 63 aligns with Java 19) and the JaCoCo plugin's ability to process it. It appears that the JaCoCo plugin version used (0.8.7) does not support the new class file format introduced with Java 19. This results in a failure during the code coverage reporting phase (`jacoco:report`), subsequently failing the overall Maven build post-successful unit tests execution.

Therefore, the unit test itself (`hashCodeIdenticalObjects`) does not have a logical or syntactic problem, but rather the Maven build fails due to a compatibility issue between Java 19 and the JaCoCo plugin. The solution would be to upgrade to a newer version of JaCoCo that supports Java 19, or alternatively, compile the project with an older version of Java that is supported by the current JaCoCo version in use. This would resolve the build failure occurring in the JaCoCo report generation phase.
