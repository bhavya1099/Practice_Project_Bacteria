Certainly! Here are several test scenarios for the `hashCode` method in the `Address` entity:

```
Scenario 1: Basic Equality Test

Details:
  TestName: hashCodesAreEqualForSameCoordinates
  Description: This test verifies that two Address objects with the same x and y coordinates produce the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with identical x and y values.
  Act: Retrieve the hash code for both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes of the two addresses are equal.
Validation:
  The test validates that the java.util.Objects.hash method is applied correctly based on the parameters (x, y). Consistent hash codes are crucial for correct behavior in hash-based collections.

Scenario 2: Different Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: hashCodesDifferForDifferentCoordinates
  Description: Test to ensure that Address objects with different x or y coordinates produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with different x and/or y values.
  Act: Retrieve the hash code for both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes of the two addresses are not equal.
Validation:
  Verifies that the Address hash code generation considers both x and y values. Differences in these should lead to different hash codes, increasing the efficiency of hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Negative Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: handleNegativeCoordinates
  Description: Ensure that the hash code method correctly handles negative coordinates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance where either x or y (or both) are negative.
  Act: Compute the hash code of this address.
  Assert: Confirm that a valid hash code is returned (non-null and consistent upon repeated calls).
Validation:
  This test checks that negative values do not cause errors or inconsistencies in hash code generation, showing robustness of the hashCode implementation.

Scenario 4: Large Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: handleLargeCoordinates
  Description: Test the hashCode method's behavior with very large coordinate values to check for any arithmetic overflow or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with very large values for x and y.
  Act: Compute the hash code of this address.
  Assert: Ensure a valid hash code is generated.
Validation:
  Confirms that the hashCode method can handle large integers without overflow, ensuring valid hash code generation for all legitimate integer values of x and y.

Scenario 5: Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: consistencyOfHashCodesAcrossCalls
  Description: Validate that hash codes remain consistent across multiple calls for the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Address instance.
  Act: Compute the hash code multiple times for this single instance.
  Assert: Check that all computed hash codes are identical.
Validation:
  Ensures the stability of the hash code generation in the Address class, which is essential for the correct functioning of hash-based collections where the objects might be repeatedly hashed.
```

These scenarios extensively test the `hashCode()` method under various common and edge conditions to ensure robustness and correctness in typical use cases and potential boundary scenarios.
