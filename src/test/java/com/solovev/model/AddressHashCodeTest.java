"""
Scenario 1: Consistent hashCode for same object instance

Details:
  TestName: testConsistentHashCodeForSameInstance
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode method consistently returns the same hash code when called multiple times on the same Address object instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address using specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the Address instance multiple times.
  Assert: Compare the results of each hashCode method call to assess if they are the same.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures the hash code is consistently generated for the same object, as expected in Java's general contract for the hashCode method.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Consistency in hash code generation is crucial for the correct function of hash-based collections like HashSet or HashMap.

"""

"""
Scenario 2: Equal objects have identical hashCode

Details:
  TestName: testEqualObjectsShareHashCode
  Description: This test ensures that two Address objects deemed equal by their equals method have identical hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical Address instances with the same x and y coordinates.
  Act: Obtain the hashCode for both instances.
  Assert: Check if the hash codes of both instances are equal.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Validates the invariant that equal objects must have identical hash codes.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Maintains the general contract of the equals and hashCode methods, ensuring reliable performance of hash-based data structures.

"""

"""
Scenario 3: Different objects have distinct hashCode

Details:
  TestName: testDifferentObjectsHaveDifferentHashCode
  Description: Tests that two different Address objects (different in terms of x or y coordinates) usually produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances with distinct x or y coordinates.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both instances.
  Assert: Verify that the hash codes are different most of the time.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Checks the ability of the hashCode method to generate different hash codes for different objects, reducing hash collisions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures more efficient performance in hash-based data structures by minimizing collisions.

"""

"""
Scenario 4: Same hashCode for symmetrical coordinates

Details:
  TestName: testSameHashCodeForSymmetricalCoordinates
  Description: Tests that Address objects with swapped x and y values (but with the same sum of coordinates) might produce the same hash code, highlighting how the hash function responds to symmetrical values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances where one has coordinates (x, y) and the other (y, x).
  Act: Calculate the hash codes of both instances.
  Assert: Check if the hash codes are identical.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Assesses the hash function's sensitivity to the order of coordinates if any.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Useful for understanding the hashing behavior and potential for collisions in scenarios with symmetrical coordinate inputs.
"""

"""
Scenario 5: Negative coordinates result in valid hashCode

Details:
  TestName: testHashCodeWithNegativeCoordinates
  Description: Verifies that Address objects initialized with negative coordinates still produce a valid hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with negative x and/or y coordinates.
  Act: Calculate the hashCode of the Address instance.
  Assert: Validate that a hash code is generated (an Integer is returned).
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Confirms that hashCode method can handle negative inputs and still function correctly.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensures robustness of hashCode implementation across negative coordinate values, supporting a broader range of address inputs.
