**Scenario 1: Validate PetriDish with Positive Size**

Details:
TestName: validateCorrectSizeForPositiveValue
Description: This test verifies that the `getSize()` method returns the correct size when the `PetriDish` object is initialized with a positive size. It ensures that the method accurately accesses and returns the size field of the class.

Execution:
Arrange: Instantiate a `PetriDish` object with a specific positive size value.
Act: Call the `getSize()` method on the instantiated object.
Assert: Verify that the returned size is equal to the initialized value.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the size returned by `getSize()` is the same as the value set during object initialization. This test confirms that `getSize()` accurately reflects the state of the PetriDish object without any alterations, crucial for validating the integrity of data handling within the class.

**Scenario 2: Validate PetriDish with Zero Size**

Details:
TestName: validateSizeForZeroValue
Description: This test examines the `getSize()` method to confirm that it correctly handles and returns a size of zero. It aims to verify that the PetriDish can signify an uninitialized or minimally initialized state without errors.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize a `PetriDish` object with size set to zero.
Act: Invoke the `getSize()` method on this object.
Assert: Assert that the output is zero.

Validation:
This test ensures that `getSize()` properly returns a size of zero, critical for cases where the PetriDish might represent a minimal or non-existent growth environment. The correctness of this scenario supports the functionality of handling boundary conditions within the application.

---

**Scenario 3: Validate PetriDish under Multi-threaded Access**

Details:
TestName: validateConcurrentAccessToSize
Description: This test checks the thread safety of the `getSize()` method by accessing it from multiple threads simultaneously. It ensures that concurrent read operations do not lead to data corruption or race conditions.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a `PetriDish` object and initialize it with a known size. Set up multiple threads to read the size concurrently.
Act: Execute all threads and each thread calls the `getSize()` method.
Assert: Collect all results from threads and assert that each thread retrieved the same size value as initialized.

Validation:
The assertion validates the consistency of size value retrieval under concurrent access, ensuring that `getSize()` is thread-safe for read operations. This test is essential, especially if the PetriDish is accessed in a multi-threaded application, confirming robustness and reliability of the method.

---

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `getSize()` method's behavior, both under normal and extreme conditions, bolstering confidence in its correctness and stability across different application states.
