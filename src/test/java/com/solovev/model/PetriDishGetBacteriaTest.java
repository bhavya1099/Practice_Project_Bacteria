Scenario 1: Retrieve Bacteria From Populated Address

Details:
  TestName: retrieveBacteriaFromPopulatedAddress
  Description: This test checks that the getBacteria method returns a Bacteria object for an address that is populated with a bacteria.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PetriDish and populate it with a known Bacteria instance at a specific Address.
  Act: Invoke the getBacteria method with the coordinates of the populated address.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Bacteria instance equals the one that was originally placed.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that getBacteria correctly identifies and returns the Bacteria at a given address when it is occupied. This is significant for ensuring data integrity when tracking bacterial locations within the dish.

Scenario 2: Retrieve Bacteria From Empty Address

Details:
  TestName: retrieveBacteriaFromEmptyAddress
  Description: This test ensures that the getBacteria method returns null for an address where no bacteria is present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PetriDish without adding any Bacteria at a specific address.
  Act: Invoke the getBacteria method on the empty address coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  This test confirms that getBacteria successfully identifies empty spatial segments in the dish, which is crucial for accurately understanding the distribution and propagation of bacteria.

Scenario 3: Retrieve Bacteria Using Negative Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: retrieveBacteriaUsingNegativeCoordinates
  Description: This test verifies how the getBacteria method handles being passed negative coordinates, ensuring error handling or boundary conditions are respected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PetriDish.
  Act: Call getBacteria with negative values for x and y.
  Assert: Assert that the method does not throw an exception and returns null.
Validation:
  The aim is to ensure that the method safely handles invalid input without causing disruptions, demonstrating robustness in the face of potential user errors or unusual requests.

Scenario 4: Retrieve Bacteria Using Out-of-Bound Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: retrieveBacteriaUsingOutOfBoundsCoordinates
  Description: This test checks the method's response to coordinates that exceed the Petri Dish's dimensions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PetriDish of known, limited size and populate it appropriately.
  Act: Attempt to retrieve Bacteria using coordinates outside the dishâ€™s bounds.
  Assert: Assert that the result is null.
Validation:
  Verifies that getBacteria properly handles requests outside the logical area of the dish, crucial for avoiding array index errors or exceptions due to invalid address references.

Scenario 5: Consistency Check When Retrieving Bacteria Multiple Times

Details:
  TestName: consistencyCheckWhenRetrievingBacteriaMultipleTimes
  Description: This test evaluates whether retrieving bacteria from the same populated address consistently returns the same result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PetriDish with a Bacteria at a specific Address.
  Act: Retrieve bacteria multiple times from the same address.
  Assert: Assert all returned results are identical and equal to the original instance.
Validation:
  This test verifies consistency and reliability of data retrieval from the PetriDish, which is crucial for stable scientific observations and experiments.
