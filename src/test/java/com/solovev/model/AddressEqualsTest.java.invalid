**Scenario 1: Comparing two Address objects with identical coordinates**

Details:  
TestName: compareIdenticalAddresses  
Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when compared with another Address object that has identical x and y coordinates. This will ensure that the method recognizes identical geographical points correctly.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same coordinate values (x = 5, y = 10).  
Act: Invoke the equals method by comparing these two Address objects.  
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the result is true.  
Validation:  
The assertion checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two addresses with identical coordinates are indeed equal. This is crucial for accurate comparisons that might affect data handling and unique identification in collections like sets or maps that rely on object equality.

**Scenario 2: Comparing Address object with null**

Details:  
TestName: compareAddressWithNull  
Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when the Address object is compared with a null value. This case verifies the robustness of the equals method against null references.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Create an Address object with specific coordinates (x = 3, y = 7).  
Act: Compare the Address object with null using the equals method.  
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the result is false.  
Validation:  
The assertion confirms that the equals method correctly handles null comparisons, preventing potential null pointer exceptions and ensuring system stability when interacting with uninitialized objects.

**Scenario 3: Comparing two Address objects with different coordinates**

Details:  
TestName: compareDifferentAddresses  
Description: This test checks if the equals method returns false when comparing two Address objects with different coordinates. This verifies that addresses are distinctly recognized based on their coordinates.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Create two Address objects with different coordinates (address1 with x = 8, y = 3, and address2 with x = 3, y = 8).  
Act: Compare address1 with address2 using the equals method.  
Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.  
Validation:  
This ensures that the equals method accurately identifies Address objects with different geographic locations as unequal, which is essential for correct data segregation and unique identification.

**Scenario 4: Comparing Address object against an object of a different class**

Details:  
TestName: compareWithDifferentClassObject  
Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when an Address object is compared with an object of a different class. This checks the type-safety of the equals method.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Create an Address object and a String object.  
Act: Invoke the equals method to compare these two objects.  
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure the result is false.  
Validation:  
Asserting false confirms that equals method respects the class type, preventing logic errors in collections or operations where type consistency is important. 

**Scenario 5: Reflexive property of equals method on an Address**

Details:  
TestName: checkReflexivePropertyOfEquals  
Description: This test ensures that the equals method is reflexive, meaning an object must equal itself. It evaluates the fundamental property of the equals method required for reliable operation.  
Execution:  
Arrange: Create an Address object with specified coordinates (x = 1, y = 4).  
Act: Compare the Address object to itself using the equals method.  
Assert: Assert that the result is true.  
Validation:  
This test checks the reflexive property, which is crucial for consistent behavior in various Java utilities and collections where object equality checks are common.
