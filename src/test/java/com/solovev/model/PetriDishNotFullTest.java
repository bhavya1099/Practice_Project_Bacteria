```
Scenario 1: Dish is exactly full

Details:
  TestName: dishIsExactlyFull
  Description: Tests if the notFull method returns false when the number of filled positions (fill) is equal to the maximum possible capacity of the dish (size * size).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a PetriDish object with fill equal to size * size.
  Act: Call the method notFull() on this PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Check if the result of notFull() is false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion checks that when a dish has no more space to accommodate additional entities, notFull should return false. This confirms the dish's capacity handling is accurate.

Scenario 2: Dish is not full

Details:
  TestName: dishIsNotFull
  Description: Tests if the notFull method correctly recognizes that the PetriDish is not full (has more space available) when the fill is less than size * size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a PetriDish with fill set to less than size * size (for example, fill = 1 in a 10x10 dish).
  Act: Call the method notFull() on this PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Check if the result of notFull() is true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that notFull returns true when there is still space left in the dish to be filled. This test ensures that the method properly indicates dish's capacity status, which is crucial for operations that depend on knowing whether more entities can be added to the dish.

Scenario 3: New empty dish

Details:
  TestName: newEmptyDish
  Description: Evaluate the functionality of notFull when a PetriDish is newly initialized and completely empty (fill = 0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new PetriDish object with fill set to 0.
  Act: Call the notFull() method on this PetriDish.
  Assert: Assert that notFull() returns true.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: This test verifies that an empty dish is recognized as not full, allowing for operations that populate the dish to proceed. This ensures the method's correctness from the start of a dish's lifecycle.

Scenario 4: Dish exceeding supposed full limit

Details:
  TestName: dishWithOverCapacityFill
  Description: Test the notFull method when the fill accidentally or improperly exceeds the capacity of the PetriDish (size * size).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a PetriDish instance where fill exceeds size * size.
  Act: Call the notFull() method on this excessively filled dish.
  Assert: Assert that notFull() returns false.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result: Checking notFull returns false even when the fill surpasses the total capacity ensures robust handling of data integrity issues. This result is important for detecting and managing anomalies in dish capacity usage.
```

These scenarios should thoroughly test the `notFull` method under various conditions, outlining its behavior in different dish states.
