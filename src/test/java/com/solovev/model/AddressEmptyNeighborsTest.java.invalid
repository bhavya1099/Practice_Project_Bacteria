``` 
Scenario 1: Center Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForCenterPosition
  Description: Validates that the emptyNeighbors method returns all surrounding addresses that are empty and excludes the address itself for a position not on the edge of the grid. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address in the center of a grid (e.g., size = 5 and position (2,2)) and mock necessary elements to make surrounding addresses empty.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to confirm that the returned collection contains all possible neighboring addresses, excluding the address itself.
Validation: 
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result by checking that the method accurately filters out the non-empty and same positions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in terms of ensuring the method behaves as expected for internal grid positions.
  
Scenario 2: Edge Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForEdgePosition
  Description: Tests the emptyNeighbors method for an address located on the edge of the grid to ensure it only considers valid grid positions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Address at an edge (e.g., size = 5 and position (0,0)) and set relevant conditions to check boundary behavior.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors on this edge address.
  Assert: Ensure the collection of neighbors excludes out-of-bound addresses and the address itself.
Validation: 
  Expound on how the test checks boundary constraints and empty condition validation.
  Discuss the practicality of ensuring that edge positions do not lead to exceptions or inclusion of invalid addresses.

Scenario 3: Corner Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForCornerPosition
  Description: Ensures that emptyNeighbors correctly identifies neighbors for a corner position, limiting checks to the bounds of the grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an Address in the corner of the grid (e.g., size = 5 and position (4,4)), simulating a corner position.
  Act: Execute the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Validate that returned neighbors are correct and within grid limits, excluding the address itself.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that corner handling is effectively managed, checking against array boundary issues and maintaining expected functionality.
  Shows the importance of accurate neighbor retrieval in special cases such as grid corners which have fewer neighboring cells.

Scenario 4: Fully Populated Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkFullyPopulatedNeighbors
  Description: Verifies whether the emptyNeighbors method correctly identifies no neighbors when all surrounding addresses are occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a grid where all surrounding addresses of a central Address instance are populated (not null).
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on this central Address.
  Assert: Assertions verify that the result is an empty collection.
Validation: 
  Confirms that the method accurately recognizes and excludes non-empty neighboring positions.
  Highlights the methodâ€™s reliability in dense scenarios where spatial checks are crucial.
``` 

Each of these scenarios examines different aspects and constraints of the `emptyNeighbors` method, providing a comprehensive test suite that ensures this method handles various spatial configurations robustly.
