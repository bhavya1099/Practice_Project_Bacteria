``` 
Scenario 1: Center Position Neighbor Test

Details:  
  TestName: centerPositionNeighborTest
  Description: Test the `emptyNeighbors` method to ensure it correctly finds all empty neighbors for an Address positioned at the center of the grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Initialize a PetriDish of size 5x5 with a central Address at (2, 2).
    - Mock or stub the `addresses` map to return null for neighboring Addresses, implying they are empty.
  Act: 
    - Call the `emptyNeighbors` method for the central Address.
  Assert: 
    - Assert that the returned collection includes all expected neighboring Addresses: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).
Validation: 
  - Checks that the method does not include the central Address itself and only returns neighboring Addresses that are empty.
  - Validates that the method operates correctly within a non-boundary context by identifying and excluding self from the neighbors.

Scenario 2: Corner Position Neighbor Test

Details:  
  TestName: cornerPositionNeighborTest
  Description: Test the `emptyNeighbors` method to ensure it correctly identifies the neighbors for an Address positioned at the corner (0,0) of the grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Instantiate a PetriDish with a size of 3x3, placing an Address at (0, 0).
    - Mock or stub `addresses` such that all surroundings but (1,1) return null.
  Act: 
    - Invoke `emptyNeighbors` from the Address at (0, 0).
  Assert: 
    - The collection should only contain the Addresses (0,1) and (1,0) if they are empty.
Validation:
  - Ensures that the method correctly adjusts range calculations for edge cases like corners without attempting to access out-of-bounds areas.
  - Validates functionality when minimal boundaries restrict the number of possible neighbors.

Scenario 3: Boundary Condition Vertical Edge Test

Details:  
  TestName: boundaryConditionVerticalEdgeTest
  Description: Verify that `emptyNeighbors` method correctly handles Addresses on a vertical boundary, such as (0, 2) in a 4x4 grid.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a PetriDish configured with size 4x4 and an Address at (0, 2).
    - Configure `addresses` to simulate surrounding empty spaces.
  Act:
    - Execute `emptyNeighbors` for this boundary Address.
  Assert:
    - Validate that the returned set includes (0, 1), (0, 3), and (1, 2).
Validation:
  - Confirms the method's capability to handle Addresses located on vertical edges, ensuring no negative indices and correctly limits checks within the grid borders.
  - Critical for confirming that the method can adjust neighbor checking dynamically based on Address position.

Scenario 4: All Neighbors Non-empty

Details:  
  TestName: allNeighborsNonEmptyTest
  Description: Test the `emptyNeighbors` method in a scenario where all potential neighboring Addresses are non-empty.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Construct a PetriDish and an Address position within it.
    - Stub `addresses` to return non-null entries for all neighbors.
  Act:
    - Utilize the `emptyNeighbors` method on this specific Address.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the result is an empty collection.
Validation:
  - Assesses the method's efficiency in identifying non-empty neighboring Addresses and ensuring they're not included in the results.
  - Highlights method's sensitivity and correctness in distinguishing between empty and non-empty Addresses.
``` 

These scenarios ensure comprehensive testing of the `emptyNeighbors` method's handling of different positional contexts within the grid, adjusting ranges, and correctly identifying empty spaces among neighbors.
