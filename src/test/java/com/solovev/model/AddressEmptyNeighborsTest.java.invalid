``` 
Scenario 1: Center Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForCenterPosition
  Description: Validates that the emptyNeighbors method returns all surrounding addresses that are empty for an Address located at the center of the grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the Address object at a central position (e.g., (5,5) in a 10x10 grid) and mock the addresses map to return null for surrounding addresses, indicating they are empty.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on the Address object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Collection contains the correct addresses around the central position, and that all are empty.
Validation: 
  This checks that the method correctly identifies all empty neighboring addresses around a central point. Validating this ensures the method's reliability in typical usage scenarios, crucial for spatial calculations in grid-like structures.
  
Scenario 2: Edge Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForEdgePosition
  Description: Validate that the emptyNeighbors method correctly identifies and returns only the valid surrounding empty addresses when the Address is located at the edge of the grid, avoiding out-of-bound errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object at an edge position (e.g., (0,5) in a 10x10 grid), with adjacent positions mockingly set to null if they are within bounds.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on this Address.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns the correct set of addresses, verifying no out-of-bound addresses are included.
Validation: 
  Testing edge positions is essential to ensure that the method respects grid boundaries and doesn't attempt to access out-of-bound indices, which could lead to errors.

Scenario 3: Corner Position Neighbor Check

Details:  
  TestName: checkNeighborsForCornerPosition
  Description: Validate that emptyNeighbors identifies and returns the correct empty neighboring addresses for an address located at the corner of the grid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an Address object at a corner (e.g., (0,0) in a 10x10 grid) and mock surroundings to simulate empty spaces where applicable.
  Act: Call emptyNeighbors on this corner Address.
  Assert: Ensure the collection contains only the valid neighboring addresses and that no extra or incorrect addresses are included.
Validation: 
  Corner cases are critical as they test the method's ability to handle minimum boundary conditions without errors, ensuring robustness.

Scenario 4: No Empty Neighbors

Details:  
  TestName: checkNoEmptyNeighbors
  Description: Tests the emptyNeighbors method when all the surrounding neighbors are not empty (i.e., each adjacent address is already occupied).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an Address in a position with all adjacent spots filled (use mock to set non-null values for neighboring addresses).
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned collection is empty.
Validation: 
  It's important to confirm that the method accurately recognizes and excludes non-empty neighboring positions, crucial for functionalities reliant on spatial vacancy.

Scenario 5: Include Self Check

Details:  
  TestName: excludeSelfInNeighbors
  Description: Ensures the method does not mistakenly include the address itself in the returned collection of empty neighbors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Location the Address in any grid position and mock surroundings including the position itself.
  Act: Execute the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Validate that the returned addresses do not contain the address itself.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the self-check condition (!addressToAdd.equals(this)) effectively prevents the method from erroneously including the original address as its own neighbor, crucial for avoiding logical errors in neighbor-related operations.
  
```
These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive coverage of typical, boundary, and special cases for the `emptyNeighbors` method's functionality.
