```plaintext
Scenario 1: Address at corner position with no occupied neighbors

Details:
  TestName: fetchEmptyNeighborsForCornerAddress
  Description: This test verifies whether the emptyNeighbors method correctly identifies all surrounding addresses as empty when an address at the map corner (0,0) has no occupied neighboring addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at (0,0) and mock the address map to return null for any queried positions indicating they are unoccupied.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on this corner address.
  Assert: Check if the returned collection includes correct potential neighboring addresses, which should only be (0,1) and (1,0) in this scenario.
Validation:
  Verify that the method correctly calculates neighbor boundaries and recognizes all potential neighbors as empty, excluding itself. The correctness ensures that edge addresses are handled properly by the method.

Scenario 2: Address at center position with all neighbors occupied

Details:
  TestName: fetchEmptyNeighborsForCenterAddressAllOccupied
  Description: This test ensures that the emptyNeighbors method returns an empty collection for an address surrounded by occupied addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at center (assuming a grid size, e.g., (1,1) for a 3x3 grid) and simulate every neighboring address as occupied.
  Act: Call emptyNeighbors method on this address.
  Assert: Assert that the returned collection is empty.
Validation:
  Verify the method's ability to correctly identify and exclude occupied neighboring addresses. This test illustrates the method's functionality in a densely populated area of the grid.

Scenario 3: Address with mixed neighbor status

Details:
  TestName: fetchEmptyNeighborsWithMixedOccupation
  Description: This test checks the accuracy of the emptyNeighbors method in identifying empty neighbors when some are occupied and others are not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address at a position, for instance (1,1), with a mixed set of occupied and unoccupied neighbors.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on this address.
  Assert: Check that only unoccupied neighboring addresses are returned.
Validation:
  Confirm that the method can discern between occupied and unoccupied addresses correctly, maintaining accurate neighbor calculation for addresses not at grid edges.

Scenario 4: Address on a boundary with an empty grid

Details:
  TestName: fetchEmptyNeighborsForBoundaryAddressInEmptyGrid
  Description: Test to determine if the emptyNeighbors method properly recognizes and returns all valid neighboring addresses for an address on a grid boundary (e.g., (0,1)) when no neighbors are occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup an Address at (0,1) on a grid edge with no occupied neighbors around.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Validate that the method returns correct neighboring addresses, which should include (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).
Validation:
  This scenario tests boundary calculations and correct handling of unoccupied spaces, ensuring the method behaves consistently at borders of the grid.

Scenario 5: Isolated Address with no valid neighbors due to grid constraints

Details:
  TestName: fetchEmptyNeighborsForIsolatedAddress
  Description: Evaluate the emptyNeighbors method for an address placed at edge (0,0) in a minimal grid (size == 1), where no other addresses exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Position Address at (0,0) in a grid of size 1x1.
  Act: Execute the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned collection of neighbors is empty.
Validation:
  Confirm the method effectively handles grid size constraints by not falsely assigning non-existent neighbors, crucial for accurate grid edge case handling.
