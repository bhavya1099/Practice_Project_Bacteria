``` 
Scenario 1: Testing hashCode for equality with identical coordinates

Details:  
  TestName: checkEqualHashCodesForIdenticalCoordinates
  Description: Validates that two Address objects having the same x and y coordinates produce the same hash code. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same x and y values.
  Act: Calculate the hash code of both objects using the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that both hash codes are identical.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly computes hash codes based on the x and y values of the Address objects, ensuring consistency in hash-based data structures like HashSet or HashMap. This test checks the part of the contract of hashCode that equal objects must produce the same hash code.

Scenario 2: Testing hashCode for inequality with different coordinates

Details:
  TestName: checkDifferentHashCodesForDifferentCoordinates
  Description: Ensures that two Address objects with different x and/or y coordinates produce different hash codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different x and y coordinates.
  Act: Calculate the hash code for each object using the hashCode method.
  Assert: Assert that the hash codes of the two objects are not the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that hashCode method is sensitive to differences in x and y values, which complies with the requirement that unequal objects ideally should have unequal hash codes (although hash collisions can occur).

Scenario 3: Testing consistent hashCode on repeated calls

Details:  
  TestName: checkConsistencyOfHashCodeOnMultipleCalls
  Description: Verifies that calling the hashCode method multiple times on the same object returns the same hash code every time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single Address object.
  Act: Call the hashCode method on this object multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that all hash code results are the same across all invocations.
Validation: 
  Validates that the hashCode method returns a consistent hash code across multiple invocations for the same object. This consistency is essential for the reliable operation of hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Testing hashCode contract with equals method

Details:
  TestName: verifyHashCodeAlignsWithEquals
  Description: Ensures that if two Address objects are equal (as per the equals method), then their hash codes must also be the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same coordinates, ensuring that equals method will return true when comparing both.
  Act: Retrieve the hash codes of both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hashes are identical.
Validation:
  Reinforces the contract between equals and hashCode that if two objects are equal according to equals, then calling hashCode on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. This scenario guarantees consistency in hash-based structures where equality check and hash code distribution are pivotal.
``` 

These scenarios address various critical aspects of the hashCode implementation's behavior in relation to the equality and uniqueness of Address objects, providing comprehensive testing of the function's reliability and correctness.
