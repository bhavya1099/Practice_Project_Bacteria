Certainly! Here are several test scenarios for the `hashCode` method in the `Address` entity:

### Scenario 1: Valid Hash Code for Positive Coordinates
Details:  
  TestName: testValidHashCodeWithPositiveCoordinates  
  Description: Tests that hashCode returns consistent hash results when provided with positive x and y coordinates.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with the same positive x and y coordinates.  
  Act: Calculate the hashCode for both instances.  
  Assert: Check if the hashCodes for both instances are the same.  
Validation:  
  This ensures that the hashCode implementation correctly computes the hash based on x and y values, and the same coordinates always result in the same hash code, affirming the consistency needed for object comparisons in hash-based collections.

### Scenario 2: Valid Hash Code for negative Coordinates
Details:  
  TestName: testValidHashCodeWithNegativeCoordinates  
  Description: Assesses the hashCode method with negative x and y coordinates to ensure hash consistency.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Instantiate two Address objects with identical negative x and y values.  
  Act: Obtain the hashCode for both instances.  
  Assert: Confirm that both Address instances have the same hashCode.  
Validation:  
  Validates that the hashCode method handles negative coordinate inputs correctly, ensuring consistent hash results which is crucial for hash-based data structures like HashMap or HashSet.

### Scenario 3: Zero Coordinates Hash Code
Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeWithZeroCoordinates  
  Description: Verify that the hashCode is consistent for Addresses initialized at the origin (0,0).  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances both at (0,0).  
  Act: Fetch the hashCode for both Address objects.  
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes are identical.  
Validation:  
  Ensures that the origin point, commonly used as a default or initial condition in many applications, has a reliable and consistent hashCode, which supports operations in hash-based collections.

### Scenario 4: Different Coordinates Same Hash Code
Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentCoordinatesSameHashCode  
  Description: Evaluate if different coordinates could inadvertently produce the same hash code, which is generally an edge case.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Construct two Address instances with different coordinates likely to yield colliding hash codes.  
  Act: Calculate hashCodes for both instances.  
  Assert: Assert that the hashCodes are different.  
Validation:  
  Tests the robustness of the hash function against collisions. It is crucial for maintaining performance in hash-based data structures where collisions can slow down performance and lead to inefficiencies. 

### Scenario 5: Consistency of Hash Code on Same Object
Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistencyOnSameObject  
  Description: Checks that repeated calls to hashCode on the same object instance return the same value.  
Execution:  
  Arrange: Create a single Address object with any set of coordinates.  
  Act: Call hashCode multiple times on this single object.  
  Assert: Validate that all hashCode results are equal.  
Validation:  
  Confirms that the hashCode method is stable and consistent when invoked multiple times on the same object, which is crucial for the reliable operation of hash-based collections where objects might be rehashed multiple times.

These scenarios comprehensively test the behavior of the `hashCode` method under various conditions, ensuring that it behaves as expected in realistic and edge-case scenarios relevant to its usage in Java collections and beyond.
