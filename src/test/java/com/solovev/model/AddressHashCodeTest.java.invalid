"""
Scenario 1: Consistent hashCode for same object

Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistencyCheck
  Description: Ensure that calling the hashCode method on the same Address object multiple times returns the same integer each time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the Address instance more than once.
  Assert: Check that all invocations return the same result.
Validation:
  Validate that the hash codes are consistent across multiple invocations. This consistency is fundamental for correctly storing objects in hash-based collections like HashSet, HashMap, where the object's hash must not change.

Scenario 2: Different objects with same coordinates produce same hashCode

Details:
  TestName: sameCoordinatesSameHashCodeCheck
  Description: Verify that two different Address objects having the same x and y coordinates yield the same hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Address class with identical x and y values.
  Act: Call hashCode on both instances.
  Assert: Assert that the two hashCodes are equal.
Validation:
  This check ensures that the hashCode implementation respects the equality of Address objects (as defined by their equals method). It is important for the correct functionality of hash-based collections where objects are expected to hash to the same buckets if they are equal.

Scenario 3: Addresses with different coordinates have different hashCodes

Details:
  TestName: differentCoordinatesDifferentHashCodeCheck
  Description: Confirm that Address instances with different coordinates generally have different hash codes, though collisions are technically allowable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of Address with different x and y values.
  Act: Calculate hash codes for each Address instance.
  Assert: Compare these hashes to assert they are generally distinct.
Validation:
  Checks that the hash function provides a good distribution of hash codes, which is vital for performance in hash-based collections. This test helps us assess the spread and collision rate, critical for managing large sets of data effectively.

Scenario 4: Confirm hashCode changes with coordinate change

Details:
  TestName: coordinateChangeReflectsInHashCode
  Description: Check if a change in x or y coordinates leads to a change in the resulting hash code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance and note its hash code. Change its coordinates.
  Act: Calculate the new hash code after changing coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the new hash code is different from the original.
Validation:
  Ensure the hashCode updates when the object's state changes. While technically not necessary for correct hashCode behavior, this test checks the sensitivity of the hash to changes in object data, which can impact the behavior in dynamic use cases where object properties might change while stored in collections.
