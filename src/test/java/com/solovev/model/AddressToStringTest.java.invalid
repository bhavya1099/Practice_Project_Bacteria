``` 
Scenario 1: Test Proper Formatting of the toString Output

Details:  
  TestName: checkToStringFormat
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method correctly formats the output string. This is to ensure the method adheres to the specified format "Address{x,y}" for any given x and y values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with specific x and y coordinates.
  Act: Call the toString method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Compare the result of the toString method to the expected formatted string "Address{x,y}".
Validation: 
  The assertion checks if the format "Address{x,y}" is strictly followed. Correct string formatting is crucial for consistent data representation, especially in logs or debugging processes.

Scenario 2: Test toString With Extreme Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: checkToStringWithExtremeValues
  Description: Ensures the toString method accurately formats the string when Address is instantiated with extreme integer values for x and y, such as Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address using Integer.MAX_VALUE for x and Integer.MIN_VALUE for y.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on this extreme Address instance.
  Assert: Check if the returned string is "Address{2147483647,-2147483648}".
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the toString method can handle and correctly format extreme integer values. This is important for ensuring the robustness of the Address class formatting capabilities.

Scenario 3: Test toString Consistency for Same Coordinate Values

Details:
  TestName: checkToStringConsistency
  Description: This test checks if multiple calls to toString on the same Address object return consistent results. This is to ensure there are no side effects or changes in output across multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with fixed x and y coordinates.
  Act: Call toString multiple times on the same Address instance.
  Assert: Verify that all results are identical across successive calls.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures consistency, which is vital for debugging and logging, where repeated method calls should yield the same output every time.

Scenario 4: Test toString Output with Zero Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: checkToStringWithZeroCoordinates
  Description: To check if the toString method outputs correctly when both x and y are zero, as minimal boundary values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with x = 0 and y = 0.
  Act: Call toString on the Address instance.
  Assert: Ensure the output is "Address{0,0}".
Validation:
  The assertion tests the methodâ€™s correctness on boundary values. Proper function with zero values ensures reliability in edge cases.

Scenario 5: Distinct Address Instances Have Unique toString Outputs

Details:
  TestName: verifyDistinctAddressesToStringUniqueness
  Description: This test ensures that toString outputs distinguish different Address instances correctly by comparing the output of two instances with different coordinates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances with different coordinates (e.g., Address1 with x=1, y=2 and Address2 with x=3, y=4).
  Act: Call toString on both instances.
  Assert: Confirm that the outputs are different and match the expected "Address{1,2}" and "Address{3,4}" respectively.
Validation:
  Validates that toString provides a unique and accurate string representation for different Address instances, crucial for logging and monitoring distinct entities.
