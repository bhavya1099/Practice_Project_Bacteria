ROOST_METHOD_HASH=toString_a521976e45
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=toString_bbffdadaa2

Scenario 1: Verify correct toString output for typical Address values

Details:
  TestName: testToStringNormalCase
  Description: Tests if the `toString` method returns the correct string representation for an Address object with typical x and y values. This is to ensure the method accurately formats the string with the proper structure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance with x and y set to specific values (e.g., x=5, y=10).
  Act: Call the `toString` method on the created Address instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches "Address{5,10}".
Validation:
  Clarifies that the output of `toString` matches exactly with the expected format. This is crucial for ensuring that Address objects are represented consistently in logs or debugging processes.

Scenario 2: Verify toString output at boundary Address coordinates

Details:
  TestName: testToStringBoundaryCase
  Description: Verifies that the `toString` method correctly handles and represents boundary values in the Address' coordinates. This test helps to ensure that even for edge values, the formatting remains accurate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an Address object with boundary values (e.g., x=0, y=0 - assuming these are bounds).
  Act: Invoke the `toString` method on this Address instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned string is "Address{0,0}".
Validation:
  Ensures that `toString` operation handles corner cases effectively, retaining consistent formatting. This is essential for boundary value analysis and ensuring system robustness.

Scenario 3: Verify toString output with negative coordinates

Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNegativeCoordinates
  Description: Evaluates how `toString` handles negative values for x and y, which might occur in error scenarios or during abnormal system behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with negative values, e.g., x=-1, y=-5.
  Act: Execute the `toString` method on this Address instance.
  Assert: Validate that the string returned is "Address{-1,-5}".
Validation:
  Confirms that even for negative coordinate values, the `toString` method correctly formats the output string. This check is significant in debugging and error logging, where accurate information representation is crucial.
