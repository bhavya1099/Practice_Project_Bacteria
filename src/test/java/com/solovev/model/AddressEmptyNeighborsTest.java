```
Scenario 1: Address at the border with no neighbors initialized

Details:
  TestName: testAddressAtBorderWithNoNeighborsInitialized
  Description: Checks the behavior of the emptyNeighbors method when the address is at the border of the grid and none of the possible neighboring addresses have been instantiated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at position (0,0) in a grid of size 5x5 where no neighboring addresses are in the addresses map.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on this instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned collection is empty.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly identifies that there are no empty neighbor addresses available to add. The test is significant to ensure the method behaves correctly at boundary conditions, also reflecting proper grid boundary handling.

Scenario 2: Middle of the grid with all neighbors empty

Details:
  TestName: testAddressInMiddleWithAllNeighborsEmpty
  Description: Ensures that the emptyNeighbors method correctly identifies all neighboring addresses when the address is centrally located and all neighbors are not in the addresses map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at position (2,2) in a 5x5 grid, with no neighboring addresses initialized in the addresses map.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on this instance.
  Assert: Assert that the collection size returned equals the total possible neighbors (8 in this case).
Validation:
  Validates that the method can comprehensively identify all surrounding addresses as neighbors when they're all unoccupied. It underscores the methodâ€™s ability to correctly compute and check neighboring grid positions, which is crucial for correct application logic in densely populated grids.

Scenario 3: Address with self-check avoidance

Details:
  TestName: testAddressAvoidsAddingItselfAsNeighbor
  Description: Ensures that the emptyNeighbors method does not erroneously include the address itself in the returned collection of neighbors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at any grid position where neighbors could include the address itself mistakenly.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on the address.
  Assert: Ensure that the address itself is not included in the output collection of neighbors.
Validation:
  Confirms that the equals method implementation effective prevents the address from being considered its neighbor, pivotal for avoiding logical fallacies in neighbor computation.

Scenario 4: Address adjacent to an initialized and non-initialized neighbor

Details:
  TestName: testAddressNextToInitializedAndUninitializedNeighbors
  Description: Tests the emptyNeighbors method's ability to distinguish between initialized (non-null value in addresses map) and uninitialized (null value in addresses map) neighboring addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an Address at location (1,1) in a 3x3 grid with a neighboring address at (1,0) initialized in the addresses map, and another neighboring address at (1,2) not initialized.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on the address at (1,1).
  Assert: Assert that the collection includes only the address at (1,2) and excludes (1,0).
Validation:
  This scenario assesses whether the method correctly interprets and filters out neighboring addresses based on initialization status in the addresses map, ensuring robust neighbor detection essential for applications relying on dynamic grid evaluations.

Scenario 5: Corner case with maximum boundaries

Details:
  TestName: testAddressAtCornerWithMaximumBoundaries
  Description: Verifies the output of the emptyNeighbors method when an address is placed at the maximum edge of the grid and algorithmic boundary conditions are tested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at (size-1, size-1) where size is the grid size, with all neighboring positions not initialized in the addresses map.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method.
  Assert: Check that the neighbors are identified correctly without exceeding grid boundaries.
Validation:
  Validates boundary logic and grid edge handling, crucial for applications that need precise edge behavior understanding and ensure no out-of-bound errors.
