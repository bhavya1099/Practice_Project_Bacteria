```
Scenario 1: Address at the border with no neighbors initialized

Details:
  TestName: testAddressAtBorderWithNoNeighborsInitialized
  Description: Checks the behavior of the emptyNeighbors method when the address is at the border of the grid and no neighbors have been initialized in the surrounding area.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an Address instance at position (0,0) in a grid of size 5x5 with no other addresses initialized in the addresses map.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on the initialized Address instance.
  Assert: Validate that the returned collection is empty, as there are no neighbors defined in the surrounding cells.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: Ensures that the method correctly identifies lack of neighbors when none of the potential neighbor positions are initialized.
  Elaborate on significance: This test checks the method's correctness in scenarios where the address is at a grid boundary with no surrounding initialized addresses.

Scenario 2: Address in the center with all neighbors initialized

Details:
  TestName: testAddressInCenterWithAllNeighborsInitialized
  Description: Evaluate the emptyNeighbors method when the address is centrally located and all surrounding neighbors are initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at position (2,2) in a 5x5 grid where all neighboring addresses (positions (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)) have valid Address instances in the addresses map.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on this central address.
  Assert: Assess that the returned collection is empty, indicating all neighboring cells are occupied.
Validation:
  Clarify the assertion intent: Verify that no empty neighboring addresses are identified when all potential neighbors are present.
  Elaborate on significance: Important to ensure the method effectively excludes inhabited neighbor cells from the results, demonstrating accurate spatial relationship handling.

Scenario 3: Address with some neighbors initialized and some empty

Details:
  TestName: testAddressWithSomeNeighborsEmpty
  Description: Checks the behavior of the emptyNeighbors function when some neighboring cells are initialized while others are not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance at position (1,1) in a 5x5 grid with some neighbors like (0,0) and (2,2) initialized and some like (1,0) and (0,1) not initialized in the addresses map.
  Act: Execute the emptyNeighbors method on this instance.
  Assert: Confirm that the collection of returned neighbors includes only the unoccupied neighboring positions.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to demonstrate: Ensures the method can accurately differentiate between occupied and unoccupied neighboring addresses.
  Elaborate on significance: Important in ensuring the method's reliability to identify available spaces around an address, which is crucial for applications like map-based services or games.

Scenario 4: Address at the corner of the grid

Details:
  TestName: testAddressAtGridCorner
  Description: Tests the emptyNeighbors method when the address is located at a grid corner, checking boundaries and neighbor calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Position an Address at (0,0) in a grid sized 5x5 with neighboring addresses like (0,1) and (1,1) initialized.
  Act: Call the emptyNeighbors method on this address.
  Assert: Assert that the result includes positions (1,0), excluding any undefined or out-of-bounds areas.
Validation:
  Clarify what it confirms: Confirm that the method correctly calculates neighbors without exceeding grid boundaries.
  Elaborate on significance: Critical for confirming that the method handles edge cases of grid boundary positions accurately.
```

These scenarios comprehensively test the core functionalities and edge cases, ensuring that the `emptyNeighbors` method behaves correctly under various positional and initialization conditions.
