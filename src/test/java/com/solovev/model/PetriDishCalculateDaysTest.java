```
Scenario 1: Configuration with zero divider value

Details:
  TestName: testConfigurationWithZeroDivider
  Description: Test the response when the configuration of the bacteria behavior returns zero as its configuration value, which should imply no division.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ConfigurationOfBacteriaBehavior instance that returns zero from toNumber method.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method with this configuration.
  Assert: Validate that the result indicates -1 for days (indicating it will never be filled) and 0 for dead bacteria.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that under a configuration where bacteria can't divide (divider is zero), the dish will never be filled, aligned with the method logic returning -1 for such scenarios. This is crucial to ensure the method properly handles configurations leading to nonviable growth conditions.

Scenario 2: Non-sterile bacteria successfully filling the dish

Details:
  TestName: testNonSterileBacteriaFillingDish
  Description: Tests if the petri dish can be filled under a normal operable configuration where bacteria can divide and spread.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a ConfigurationOfBacteriaBehavior with a valid non-zero divider and mock the dish conditions to initially not be full and then to be full after some operations.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method using this configuration.
  Assert: Assert that the number of days is greater than 0 and check dead bacteria count.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the dish eventually becomes fully populated with bacteria, and it takes a positive number of days. Ensuring the growth dynamics are simulated accurately under favorable conditions tests the core functionality of the bacterial division and spread in the dish.

Scenario 3: NonZero Configuration but dish remains not full due to other reasons

Details:
  TestName: testValidConfigurationButDishNotFilled
  Description: Tests the scenario where, despite a valid configuration leading to divisions, the dish does not become fully filled due to conditions simulated within the putBacterias or divideBacteria methods preventing full coverage.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a valid configuration for divider and setup conditions where notFull persists as true indefinitely by mocking related behaviors.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method with the setup.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns -1 for days, indicating it will never be filled.
Validation:
  This tests the algorithm's handling of scenarios where, despite active division, other factors prevent the complete filling of the dish. It's essential to verify that the system accurately recognizes and handles indefinite growth scenarios without erroneous conclusions.

Scenario 4: Proper termination with filled dish and dead bacteria accounting

Details:
  TestName: testFilledDishAndDeadBacteriaAccounting
  Description: Checks if the dish gets fully filled and dead bacteria are accounted for in the final response correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a scenario where the dish gets filled after several divisions, and there are dead bacteria.
  Act: Call calculateDays with this configuration.
  Assert: Assert that days are counted correctly, and dead bacteria are reported in the response.
Validation:
  Ensures that when the dish is filled, all factors including days taken and dead bacteria are correctly reflected in the final output. This is critical for accurate reporting and analysis of the dish's bacterial population dynamics over time.
