**Scenario 1: Comparing two Address objects with identical coordinates**

Details:
TestName: compareIdenticalAddresses
Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns true when compared with another Address object that has identical x and y coordinates. This will ensure that the method recognizes identical geographical points correctly.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same x and y values.
- Act: Call the equals method on one Address object, passing the other as a parameter.
- Assert: Assert that the result is true.

Validation:
- The assertion checks that an object compares as equal to another object with the same x and y values.
- It is vital for the proper functioning of sets and maps which rely on correct implementations of equals to avoid duplicate entries and ensure correct retrieval of data.

**Scenario 2: Comparing an Address object with null**

Details:
TestName: compareAddressWithNull
Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when comparing an Address object to null. This check prevents NullPointerExceptions and conforms to Java equality contract requirements.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an Address object.
- Act: Call the equals method on the Address object passing null as a parameter.
- Assert: Assert that the result is false.

Validation:
- Verifies that the method safely handles null inputs without crashing, which is crucial for robust equality checks in collections and other data structures.

**Scenario 3: Comparing two Address objects with different coordinates**

Details:
TestName: compareDifferentlyCoordinatesAddresses
Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when comparing two Address objects that have different x or y coordinates. It will confirm that the method discriminates between different geographical points.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create two Address objects with different x and/or y values.
- Act: Call the equals method on one Address object, passing the other as a parameter.
- Assert: Assert that the result is false.

Validation:
- The assertion confirms the ability of the equals method to distinguish between distinct Address objects accurately.
- Ensuring accurate inequality detection is essential for data integrity in collection handling.

**Scenario 4: Comparing Address object with an object of different class**

Details:
TestName: compareAddressWithDifferentClassObject
Description: This test examines whether the equals method returns false when the Address object is compared with an object of a different class. This respects the general contract of the equals method which must return false for objects of differing class hierarchies.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an Address object and an instance of a different class (e.g., String).
- Act: Call the equals method on the Address object, passing the different class object.
- Assert: Assert that the result is false.

Validation:
- By confirming that Address does not equate itself with unrelated class objects, this assertion ensures type safety and correct type comparisons in complex data structures or logical operations.

**Scenario 5: Comparing the same Address object against itself**

Details:
TestName: compareAddressWithItself
Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns true when an Address object is compared with itself. This check is part of the reflexivity property required from the equals method.

Execution:
- Arrange: Create an Address object.
- Act: Call the equals method on this Address object, passing itself.
- Assert: Assert that the result is true.

Validation:
- Validates reflexivity of the equals method, which is a fundamental requirement in ensuring objects can correctly check for self-equivalence, reducing errors in collections and other operations where such checks are performed automatically.
