```
Scenario 1: Test Equals with Identical Objects

Details:
  TestName: compareSameObjects
  Description: Checks if the equals method returns true when the same object is compared with itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address.
  Act: Call the equals method comparing the object with itself.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an object is equal to itself, an important reflexivity property of the equals method.
  This is significant as it confirms the basic principle that an object must always equal itself.


Scenario 2: Test Equals with Null Object

Details:
  TestName: compareWithNull
  Description: Verifies that the equals method returns false when comparing an Address object with null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address.
  Act: Call the equals method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that comparing any Address object with null should yield false.
  This test is crucial as it ensures that the method is resistant to null inputs, avoiding potential NullPointerExceptions.


Scenario 3: Test Equals with Different Class Type

Details:
  TestName: compareWithDifferentClass
  Description: Ensures the equals method returns false when compared with an object of a different type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address and an instance of another class (e.g., String).
  Act: Call the equals method on the Address instance, passing the different class instance as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Asserting that false is returned confirms class type safety check in the equals method.
  It's essential to confirm that the method correctly identifies and responds to incorrect type comparisons, maintaining type safety.


Scenario 4: Test Equals with Different Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: compareDifferentCoordinates
  Description: Checks if the equals method returns false when Address instances with different coordinates are compared.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different Address instances with distinct x or y values.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two different Address instances.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the equals method's ability to detect and respond to objects with differing states.
  This is crucial for correct implementation, ensuring that only truly equivalent objects (with same x and y coordinates) are considered equal.


Scenario 5: Test Equals with Same Coordinates

Details:
  TestName: compareSameCoordinates
  Description: Verifies that the equals method returns true when comparing two Address instances with identical x and y values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with the same x and y values.
  Act: Call the equals method to compare these two Address instances.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the equal method correctly identifies objects with identical internal state (same x and y coordinates) as equal.
  It validates that the method adheres to the requirement of object equivalence based on their coordinate values, which is a critical aspect of ensuring data consistency.
