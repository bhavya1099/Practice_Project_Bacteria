```
Scenario 1: Objects Are Exactly The Same

Details:
  TestName: testObjectsAreExactlyTheSame
  Description: Tests the equals method by supplying the same object as a parameter, expecting the result to be true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address.
  Act: Call the equals method on the object, passing itself as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  Clarifies that an object is equal to itself, which is a fundamental property of the equals method. This scenario validates object identity.

Scenario 2: Objects Are Different But Have The Same Values

Details:
  TestName: testObjectsWithSameValues
  Description: Tests the equals method using two different Address instances that have the same x and y values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address instances with the same coordinates.
  Act: Compare these two instances using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies different objects with identical coordinate values as equal. Essential for confirming attribute-based equality rather than identity-based equality.

Scenario 3: Objects Have Different X values

Details:
  TestName: testObjectsDifferInX
  Description: Checks if the equals method correctly identifies two Address instances with different x values as not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Address objects with different x values but the same y value.
  Act: Invoke the equals method to compare these two addresses.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Validates that object equality is sensitive to differences in the x coordinate. Important for ensuring accuracy in distinguishing Address instances.

Scenario 4: Objects Have Different Y values

Details:
  TestName: testObjectsDifferInY
  Description: Examines whether the equals method can accurately identify that two Address instances with differing y values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with the same x value but differing y values.
  Act: Use the equals method to compare them.
  Assert: Assert that the comparison results in false.
Validation:
  Ensures that the equals method is sensitive to y-coordinate differences, which is crucial for correct functionality in a grid-like structure.

Scenario 5: One Object Is Null

Details:
  TestName: testComparingWithNull
  Description: Verifies that the equals method identifies that an Address object is not equal to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance and use a null value for comparison.
  Act: Call the equals method comparing the Address instance with null.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Validates that the equals method handles null correctly, ensuring robustness and preventing potential NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 6: Incompatible Object Type Comparison

Details:
  TestName: testComparingWithDifferentClass
  Description: Tests the equals method by comparing an Address object with an instance of an incompatible class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address instance and a String object.
  Act: Compare the Address with the String instance using the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the equals method verifies the type of the objects being compared, reinforcing type safety in equality checks.
